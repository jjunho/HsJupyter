# Constitution v1.2.0 Compliance Implementation Plan

**Target**: Address moderate constitutional compliance gaps  
**Focus**: Error handling abstraction and Rule of Three compliance  
**Estimated Effort**: 6-9 hours

## Issue 1: Error Handling Abstraction (DRY Principle)

**Current State**: Error handling patterns repeated across modules  
**Constitutional Violation**: Principle VI (Simplicity & Maintainability) - DRY violation

### Implementation Tasks

#### T001: Create Shared Error Handling Module
Create `src/HsJupyter/Runtime/ErrorHandling.hs` with common error patterns

#### T002: Extract Common Error Combinators
Extract patterns from GHCRuntime.hs, GHCDiagnostics.hs, Manager.hs

#### T003: Update Modules to Use Shared Patterns
Refactor existing modules to use shared error handling

## Issue 2: Rule of Three Compliance (Pragmatic Balance)

**Current State**: Some abstractions created before pattern establishment  
**Constitutional Violation**: Principle VIII (Pragmatic Balance) - Rule of Three

### Implementation Tasks

#### T004: Review Abstractions for Rule of Three
Identify abstractions created before establishing clear patterns

#### T005: Simplify Over-Engineered Abstractions
Simplify where patterns don't justify abstraction

#### T006: Document Remaining Complexity
Justify remaining complex abstractions with explicit reasoning

## Expected Outcomes

1. **DRY Compliance**: Eliminate error handling code duplication
2. **Rule of Three Compliance**: Ensure abstractions are justified by usage patterns
3. **Maintainability**: Improved code maintainability through shared patterns
4. **Constitutional Score**: Increase from 92/100 to 96/100
