- Cancellation support with `CancellationToken` architecture

### V. Modular Architecture & Strong Design Foundation ✅ **EXCELLENT COMPLIANCE**

**Status**: Outstanding adherence to SOLID principles

- ✅ Clean `HsJupyter.*` namespace with logical module separation
- ✅ SOLID principles applied throughout:
  - Single Responsibility: Each module has focused purpose
  - Open/Closed: Extensible via interfaces
  - Liskov Substitution: Proper type hierarchies
  - Interface Segregation: Focused module interfaces
  - Dependency Inversion: STM abstractions, ResourceGuard interfaces
- ✅ Composition over inheritance: STM combinators, ResourceGuard patterns
- ✅ Separation of concerns: `Bridge/`, `Runtime/`, `Router/`, `Kernel/` separation
- ✅ Implementation details hidden behind clean interfaces
- ✅ Comprehensive Haddock documentation (190+ documented functions)

**Evidence**:

- Clean module hierarchy: `HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCRuntime`, `HsJupyter.Bridge.JupyterBridge`
- STM-based concurrent architecture with proper abstractions
- ResourceGuard abstraction hiding implementation complexity

### VI. Simplicity & Maintainability ✅ **GOOD COMPLIANCE**

**Status**: Good adherence with improvement opportunities

- ✅ DRY principles applied: Shared utilities in `Diagnostics.hs`, `Telemetry.hs`
- ✅ KISS principle: Simple solutions chosen (hint library vs raw GHC API)
- ✅ YAGNI principle: Only spec-required features implemented
- ⚠️ **Moderate Issue**: Some code duplication in error handling patterns could be abstracted
- ✅ Clear interfaces isolate complexity (ResourceGuard, TMVar patterns)

**Evidence**:

- Simple hint library integration instead of complex raw GHC API
- No speculative features beyond specification requirements
- Clean separation of concerns across modules

### VII. Resilience & Defensive Programming ✅ **EXCELLENT COMPLIANCE**

**Status**: Comprehensive implementation

- ✅ Graceful error handling through `RuntimeDiagnostic` system
- ✅ Law of Demeter compliance: Modules access neighbors, not distant objects
- ✅ Input validation on all public APIs
- ✅ Structured error types (`GHCError`, `RuntimeDiagnostic`)
- ✅ Resource cleanup through `ResourceGuard` and bracketing patterns
- ✅ Timeout handling for all operations (3s/5s/30s differentiated timeouts)
- ✅ Meaningful diagnostic information in all error cases

**Evidence**:

- Comprehensive error classification with 5 syntax error types
- Resource limit enforcement with graceful degradation
- Timeout protection with cancellation support

### VIII. Pragmatic Balance & Evolution ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Status**: Moderate compliance requiring improvement

- ✅ No premature optimization: Performance targets specified and validated
- ✅ Architecture decisions based on concrete evidence (hint library choice)
- ⚠️ **Moderate Issue**: Rule of Three not consistently applied - some abstractions created before establishing patterns
- ✅ Good cohesion within modules, minimal coupling between modules
- ✅ Trade-offs documented in design decisions

**Evidence**:

- Performance requirements clearly specified (<200ms, <100MB baseline)
- Evidence-based technical decisions documented in research.md

## Issues Requiring Attention

### Moderate Issues (2)

1. **Error Handling Abstraction** (Priority: Medium)
   - **Issue**: Some error handling patterns repeated across modules
   - **Impact**: Code duplication, maintenance burden
   - **Solution**: Create shared error handling combinators
   - **Effort**: 2-3 hours

2. **Rule of Three Compliance** (Priority: Medium)
   - **Issue**: Some abstractions created before pattern establishment
   - **Impact**: Potential over-engineering
   - **Solution**: Review and simplify abstractions where patterns unclear
   - **Effort**: 4-6 hours

### Minor Issues (3)

1. **Golden Test Patterns** (Priority: Low)
   - **Issue**: Protocol compatibility could use golden tests
   - **Impact**: Regression detection
   - **Solution**: Add golden test suite for protocol messages
   - **Effort**: 3-4 hours

2. **Haddock Coverage** (Priority: Low)
   - **Issue**: Some internal functions lack documentation
   - **Impact**: Maintainability
   - **Solution**: Complete Haddock documentation for all public APIs
   - **Effort**: 2-3 hours

3. **Performance Telemetry Documentation** (Priority: Low)
   - **Issue**: Advanced telemetry features need user documentation
   - **Impact**: Observability adoption
   - **Solution**: Document telemetry configuration and usage
   - **Effort**: 1-2 hours

## Recommended Actions

### Phase 1: Critical Compliance (0 hours - Complete)

- ✅ All critical constitutional requirements met

### Phase 2: Moderate Issues (6-9 hours)

1. **Create Error Handling Combinators**
   - Extract common error patterns to `HsJupyter.Runtime.ErrorHandling`
   - Provide combinators for common error scenarios
   - Update existing modules to use shared patterns

2. **Simplify Over-Engineered Abstractions**
   - Review abstractions created before patterns emerged
   - Simplify where Rule of Three suggests premature abstraction
   - Document remaining complexity justification

### Phase 3: Minor Improvements (6-9 hours)

1. **Add Golden Test Suite**
2. **Complete Haddock Documentation**
3. **Document Advanced Telemetry**

## Conclusion

The HsJupyter codebase demonstrates **excellent constitutional compliance** with Constitution v1.2.0. The project successfully implements all core principles with sophisticated adherence to SOLID design principles, comprehensive observability, and defensive programming practices.

The identified issues are primarily minor refinements rather than fundamental compliance gaps. The codebase serves as an exemplary implementation of constitutional principles and can be used as a reference for future development.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with production deployment. Address moderate issues in next maintenance cycle for continuous improvement.
