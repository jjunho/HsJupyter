# HsJupyter Installation Guide (Draft)

This placeholder outlines the upcoming installation documentation. Once the bootstrap installer and binary distribution pipeline are implemented, expand each section with detailed steps and troubleshooting recipes.

## Planned Structure

1. **Quick Start**
   - One-command installer usage (`hsjupyter install`)
   - Verifying the kernel in JupyterLab
2. **Manual Installation**
   - Prerequisites (Python, Jupyter, GHC)
   - Installing from prebuilt binaries
   - Installing from source (advanced)
3. **Platform Notes**
   - Windows
   - macOS
   - Linux distributions
4. **Troubleshooting**
   - Common installer errors and fixes
   - `hsjupyter doctor` usage
5. **Uninstalling**
   - Removing binaries, caches, and kernel specs

> TODO: Populate each section as implementation milestones deliver the installer and diagnostics tooling.
