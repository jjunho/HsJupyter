## In Progress ðŸš§

### Phase 4: Installation & CLI Infrastructure

- [ ] Design CLI skeleton for `hs-jupyter-kernel install` (argument parsing, connection file handling)
- [ ] Implement Jupyter kernel installation process and registration
- [ ] Build `hs-jupyter-kernel doctor` diagnostics CLI for troubleshooting

## Upcoming ðŸ“‹

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

- [ ] Implement artifact caching and environment detection in `EnvironmentService`
- [ ] Wire completions/diagnostics capability providers behind feature flags
- [ ] Enhanced module import system with package management integration
- [ ] Interactive debugging capabilities with GHCi integration

### Phase 6: Performance & Scalability

- [ ] Author benchmark suite scaffolding (`docs/performance`) and automate runs
- [ ] Memory usage optimization for long-running sessions
- [ ] Parallel evaluation support for independent expressions
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization tools

### Phase 7: Documentation & Support

- [ ] Populate installation and configuration guides with real procedures
- [ ] Draft support knowledge base articles for top installer/runtime issues
- [ ] Create comprehensive user documentation and tutorials
- [ ] API documentation for extension developers
