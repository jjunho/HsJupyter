# Performance Benchmarks (Draft)

This directory will store benchmark definitions, tooling notes, and historical results for HsJupyter.

## Planned Deliverables

- **Benchmark Suite**
  - Criterion-based microbenchmarks for core interpreter operations
  - Notebook-driven macro benchmarks for end-to-end execution
  - Installer timing scenarios using `hyperfine`
- **Reference Environments**
  - Hardware/software profiles for repeatable measurements
  - Container definitions or scripts to reproduce benchmarks
- **Results Archive**
  - `benchmarks.json` or similar format for automated trend analysis
  - Visualisations highlighting regressions and improvements
- **How-To Guides**
  - Running the suite locally
  - Interpreting metrics and setting performance budgets

> TODO: Add actual benchmark definitions and scripts as soon as runtime prototypes are available.
