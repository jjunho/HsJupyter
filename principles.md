This project should follow principles that prioritize clarity, maintainability, and adaptability.

🧩 1. Simplicity and Clarity

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Avoid unnecessary complexity — simple designs are easier to maintain and debug.

YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It): Don’t add features until they’re actually required.

DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself): Eliminate duplication to reduce errors and simplify future changes.

These ensure that your codebase remains lean, readable, and efficient.

🏗️ 2. Strong Design Foundation

SOLID Principles:
Help create modular, flexible, and testable systems.
Each principle minimizes dependencies and maximizes code clarity.

Separation of Concerns:
Keeps each part of the system focused on a single responsibility.

Composition over Inheritance:
Encourages combining small, reusable parts rather than rigid hierarchies.

These build the architectural integrity of your project.

🧠 3. Resilience and Maintainability

Defensive Programming:
Anticipate and handle potential failures gracefully.

Law of Demeter:
Reduces tight coupling between components, keeping code modular.

Hiding Implementation Details:
Protects internal logic from unintended external use or modification.

This ensures the system can evolve safely and withstand change.

⚙️ 4. Balance and Pragmatism

Rule of Three:
Don’t refactor too early—wait until repetition proves a pattern is worth abstracting.

Maximizing Cohesion / Minimizing Coupling:
Keeps modules self-contained while ensuring they interact cleanly.

A well-balanced project knows when to optimize and when to wait.

These principles together create a robust framework for developing software that is not only functional but also elegant and enduring.
