Try to pay attention when implementing tests, so that they are not wrong. Many times tests are written incorrectly and give false positives or false negatives, which can mislead development efforts.
When writing code, always consider edge cases and error handling to ensure robustness.
Never forget DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles to keep the codebase simple, maintainable and efficient.
When documenting code, ensure clarity and completeness to facilitate future maintenance and onboarding.
Pay attention to the prompts and instructions so that you do everything correctly and nothing is missed.
