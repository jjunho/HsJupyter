# Phase 1 Demo Assets

This directory contains helper scripts for exercising the Phase 1 protocol bridge without a full Jupyter stack.

- `phase1_echo_notebook.py`: sends a signed `execute_request` via pyzmq and prints the resulting reply/stream frames using the sample connection file.
- `sample-connection.json`: minimal connection file compatible with the prototype entry point (`app/KernelMain.hs`). Update the ports if the defaults clash with local services.

## Usage

```bash
# Build the prototype kernel
cabal v2-build hs-jupyter-kernel

# Run the kernel with the sample connection file and verbose logging
cabal v2-run hs-jupyter-kernel -- --connection scripts/demo/sample-connection.json --log-level Debug

# In another terminal, run the demo to send an execute_request via pyzmq
scripts/demo/phase1_echo_notebook.py --connection scripts/demo/sample-connection.json
```

The Python helper depends on `pyzmq` and exercises the real ROUTER/PUB/REP sockets exposed by the Phase 1 prototype.
This project should follow principles that prioritize clarity, maintainability, and adaptability.

üß© 1. Simplicity and Clarity

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Avoid unnecessary complexity ‚Äî simple designs are easier to maintain and debug.

YAGNI (You Aren‚Äôt Gonna Need It): Don‚Äôt add features until they‚Äôre actually required.

DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself): Eliminate duplication to reduce errors and simplify future changes.

These ensure that your codebase remains lean, readable, and efficient.

üèóÔ∏è 2. Strong Design Foundation

SOLID Principles:
Help create modular, flexible, and testable systems.
Each principle minimizes dependencies and maximizes code clarity.

Separation of Concerns:
Keeps each part of the system focused on a single responsibility.

Composition over Inheritance:
Encourages combining small, reusable parts rather than rigid hierarchies.

These build the architectural integrity of your project.

üß† 3. Resilience and Maintainability

Defensive Programming:
Anticipate and handle potential failures gracefully.

Law of Demeter:
Reduces tight coupling between components, keeping code modular.

Hiding Implementation Details:
Protects internal logic from unintended external use or modification.

This ensures the system can evolve safely and withstand change.

‚öôÔ∏è 4. Balance and Pragmatism

Rule of Three:
Don‚Äôt refactor too early‚Äîwait until repetition proves a pattern is worth abstracting.

Maximizing Cohesion / Minimizing Coupling:
Keeps modules self-contained while ensuring they interact cleanly.

A well-balanced project knows when to optimize and when to wait.

These principles together create a robust framework for developing software that is not only functional but also elegant and enduring.# Constitution v1.2.0 Compliance Audit Report

# Build Performance Guide

## Overview

HsJupyter builds can be slow due to the **hint library** (GHC API integration). This guide provides optimization strategies for development workflows.

## Performance Issues

### Root Causes

- **hint library**: Includes full GHC API (~100MB+ dependencies)
- **Static linking**: Combines all 292+ dependencies into executable
- **GHC 9.12.2**: Newer GHC versions have compilation overhead
- **Optimization levels**: `-O1`/`-O2` perform extensive analysis

### Typical Build Times

- **Full build with optimization**: 3-5 minutes
- **Library-only build (`-O0`)**: 5-15 seconds
- **Incremental builds**: 30 seconds - 2 minutes

## Fast Development Workflow

### 1. Quick Compilation Check

```bash
# Fastest: Library only, no optimization
cabal build lib:hs-jupyter-kernel -O0
```

### 2. Targeted Testing

```bash
# Run specific test modules
cabal test unit -O0 --test-option="--match=/GHCSession/"
cabal test unit -O0 --test-option="--match=/Diagnostics/"

# Skip integration tests during active development
cabal test unit -O0
```

### 3. Incremental Development

```bash
# 1. Check compilation
cabal build lib:hs-jupyter-kernel -O0

# 2. Test specific functionality
cabal test unit -O0 --test-option="--match=/YourModule/"

# 3. Full validation (when needed)
cabal test integration -O0

# 4. Production build (final step)
cabal build  # With optimizations
```

## Build Configuration

### Project-Level Optimizations

Add to `cabal.project`:

```cabal
-- Performance optimizations
jobs: 4
documentation: False
haddock-all: False
optimization: 1
split-sections: True
```

### User-Level Configuration

Add to `~/.cabal/config`:

```cabal
jobs: 4
documentation: False
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Use multiple cores for compilation
export CABAL_BUILD_JOBS=4

# Disable documentation generation
export CABAL_BUILD_DOCS=False
```

## Development Tools

### ghcid for Instant Feedback

```bash
# Install once
cabal install ghcid

# Use for instant recompilation feedback
ghcid --command="cabal repl lib:hs-jupyter-kernel"
```

### Build Time Monitoring

```bash
# Time your builds
time cabal build lib:hs-jupyter-kernel -O0

# Monitor resource usage
cabal build -v2 | grep "Running:"
```

## Command Quick Reference

### Fast Commands (Development)

```bash
# Compilation check (5-15 seconds)
cabal build lib:hs-jupyter-kernel -O0

# Quick test run (30-60 seconds)
cabal test unit -O0

# Dependencies only (when cabal.project changes)
cabal build --dependencies-only
```

### Standard Commands (CI/Production)

```bash
# Full build with optimizations (3-5 minutes)
cabal build

# All tests (5-10 minutes)
cabal test

# Clean build (when needed)
cabal clean && cabal build
```

### Debugging Slow Builds

```bash
# Verbose output to identify bottlenecks
cabal build --verbose=2

# Check dependency tree
cabal list --installed | wc -l

# Profile build times
cabal build --enable-profiling +RTS -p
```

## Best Practices

### During Feature Development

1. **Start with library builds**: `cabal build lib:hs-jupyter-kernel -O0`
2. **Use targeted tests**: Only run tests for modules you're changing
3. **Avoid full builds**: Only run full builds when preparing for review
4. **Use ghcid**: For instant feedback on syntax/type errors

### Before Commits

1. **Clean library build**: Ensure no compilation errors
2. **Full test suite**: Run all tests with optimizations
3. **Integration tests**: Verify end-to-end functionality

### CI/Production

1. **Use optimizations**: Default build flags for performance
2. **Full test coverage**: All unit and integration tests
3. **Clean builds**: Start from clean state

## Troubleshooting

### "Build taking forever"

- Check if you're running with optimizations (`-O1`, `-O2`)
- Use `-O0` for development builds
- Ensure parallel builds are enabled (`jobs: 4`)

### "Out of memory during linking"

- Reduce optimization level
- Use `split-sections: True` in cabal.project
- Consider using dynamic linking for development

### "Tests timing out"

- Run tests without optimizations (`-O0`)
- Use targeted test execution
- Check if resource limits are too strict

## Integration with Specify Toolkit

When working with specify toolkit workflows:

```bash
# After /speckit.implement
cabal build lib:hs-jupyter-kernel -O0  # Quick check

# Targeted testing for new functionality  
cabal test unit -O0 --test-option="--match=/NewModule/"

# Full validation before marking complete
cabal test integration -O0
```

This ensures fast iteration while maintaining quality validation.
# Testing Requirements

## Runtime Statistics (RTS)

Several tests in the project require GHC's Runtime Statistics to be enabled to monitor memory usage and performance metrics.

### Running Tests with RTS Stats

To run tests that use performance monitoring and memory statistics:

```bash
cabal test unit -O0 --test-options="+RTS -T -RTS"
cabal test integration -O0 --test-options="+RTS -T -RTS"
```

### Tests Requiring RTS Stats

The following test categories require RTS statistics:

- **GHCRuntime timeout behavior tests**: Monitor execution time and memory for differentiated timeouts
- **Performance monitoring tests**: Track execution time, memory usage, and error telemetry  
- **Memory limit tests**: Enforce and monitor memory constraints
- **Resource guard tests**: Memory monitoring and limit enforcement

### Without RTS Stats

Running tests without `-T` will result in failures with:

```text
IOException of type UnsupportedOperation
unsupported operation (GHC.Stats.getRTSStats: GC stats not enabled. Use `+RTS -T -RTS' to enable them.)
```

### Production Configuration

In production kernels, enable RTS stats for monitoring:

```bash
./hs-jupyter-kernel +RTS -T -RTS
```

This enables the performance telemetry and resource monitoring features implemented in Phase 7.

```

### Toolchain Requirements

- **GHC 9.12.2+** (via `ghcup install ghc 9.12.2`)
- **Cabal 3.0+** for build management
- **Python 3.8+** with `pyzmq` for integration testing
- **Git** with feature branch workflow

### Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jjunho/HsJupyter.git
cd HsJupyter
git checkout 003-ghc-evaluation  # Latest GHC evaluation implementation

# Build and test
cabal v2-build all
cabal v2-test all
```

### Build Performance Optimization

Due to the **hint library** (GHC API integration), full builds can take several minutes. For faster development iteration:

**‚ö° Fast Development Builds:**

```bash
# Library only (5 seconds vs minutes)
cabal build lib:hs-jupyter-kernel -O0

# Quick compilation check
cabal build --dependencies-only

# Specific test suites only
cabal test unit -O0 --test-option="--match=/GHCSession/"
```

**üîß Build Configuration Optimizations:**

Add to `~/.cabal/config` or project `cabal.project`:

```cabal
-- Performance optimizations
jobs: 4
documentation: False
haddock-all: False
optimization: 1
split-sections: True
```

**üöÄ Development Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Quick compilation check
cabal build lib:hs-jupyter-kernel -O0

# 2. Run targeted tests
cabal test unit -O0 --test-option="--match=/MyModule/"

# 3. Full integration (when needed)
cabal test integration -O0

# 4. Production build (final step)
cabal build  # With optimizations
```

**Why Builds Are Slow:**

- **hint library**: Includes full GHC API (~100MB+ dependencies)
- **Static linking**: Combines all libraries into executable
- **292 dependencies**: Large dependency graph
- **GHC 9.12.2**: Newer versions can be slower

**Performance Tools:**

```bash
# Install ghcid for instant feedback
cabal install ghcid
ghcid --command="cabal repl lib:hs-jupyter-kernel"

# Monitor build times
time cabal build lib:hs-jupyter-kernel -O0
```

## Runtime Core Architecture

## Running the Prototype

- Entry point: `app/KernelMain.hs`
- CLI:
  - `--connection FILE` points to a Jupyter connection JSON (see `scripts/demo/sample-connection.json`).
  - `--log-level Debug|Info|Warn|Error` or env `HSJUPYTER_LOG_LEVEL`.

Example:

```bash
cabal v2-run hs-jupyter-kernel -- \
  --connection scripts/demo/sample-connection.json \
  --log-level Info
```

Relevant modules:

- Kernel: `src/HsJupyter/KernelProcess.hs`, `src/HsJupyter/Kernel/Types.hs`
- Bridge: `src/HsJupyter/Bridge/{JupyterBridge,HeartbeatThread}.hs`, Protocol `{Envelope,Codec}.hs`
- Router: `src/HsJupyter/Router/RequestRouter.hs`
- Runtime: `src/HsJupyter/Runtime/{Manager,GHCSession,GHCRuntime,Evaluation,Diagnostics,Telemetry,ErrorHandling,ResourceGuard,SessionState}.hs`

### Job Queue System

The runtime uses Software Transactional Memory (STM) for thread-safe job management:

```haskell
-- Runtime/Manager.hs
data RuntimeManager = RuntimeManager
  { rmQueue       :: TQueue ExecutionJob
  , rmCapacity    :: Int
  , rmSessionRef  :: TVar RuntimeSessionState  
  , rmJobRegistry :: TVar (Map JobId TMVar ())  -- Cancellation tokens
  }
```

**Key Operations:**

- `submitExecute`: Enqueue code execution with cancellation token
- `enqueueInterrupt`: Cancel running job by ID
- `withRuntimeManager`: Resource-managed lifecycle

### Session State Management

Persistent state across cell executions:

```haskell
-- Runtime/SessionState.hs  
data RuntimeSessionState = RuntimeSessionState
  { rsExecutionCount   :: Int                    -- Incremental counter
  , rsBindings        :: Map Text Text          -- Variable bindings
  , rsModuleArtifacts :: Map Text ModuleArtifact -- Compiled modules
  , rsImports         :: [Text]                 -- Import declarations
  }
```

**State Lifecycle:**

1. Initialize empty state on runtime startup
2. Increment execution count per cell
3. Accumulate bindings and imports
4. Persist across cancellation/errors

### Resource Management

Configurable resource limits with watchdog enforcement:

```haskell
-- Runtime/ResourceGuard.hs
data ResourceLimits = ResourceLimits
  { rcMaxCpuSeconds  :: Double     -- Wall-clock timeout
  , rcMaxMemoryMB    :: Int        -- Memory limit (RSS)
  , rcMaxOutputBytes :: Int        -- Output truncation limit
  , rcCpuMode        :: CpuLimitMode    -- Wall vs User time
  , rcMemoryMode     :: MemoryLimitMode -- RSS vs Virtual
  }
```

**Enforcement Mechanisms:**

- Background monitoring thread with configurable intervals
- RTS statistics integration for memory tracking
- STM-based cancellation propagation
- Output truncation at render time

### Cancellation Infrastructure

TMVar-based cancellation tokens throughout execution pipeline:

```haskell
-- Job submission creates cancellation token
cancelToken <- newEmptyTMVarIO  
let job = ExecutionJob ctx metadata code cancelToken

-- Background thread monitors for cancellation
checkCancellation :: TMVar () -> IO Bool
checkCancellation token = do
  result <- atomically $ tryReadTMVar token
  return $ isJust result
```

**Cancellation Flow:**

1. Client sends `interrupt_request`
2. RequestRouter calls `enqueueInterrupt`
3. Manager marks job's TMVar
4. Evaluation engine checks token periodically
5. Returns `status=abort` on cancellation

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

Follow numbered feature branches as per `AGENTS.md`:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b 003-feature-name

# Work in small, meaningful commits
git commit -m "Phase 1: Setup infrastructure"
git commit -m "Phase 2: Implement core types"
git commit -m "Phase 3: Add comprehensive tests"

# Push when ready for review
git push -u origin 003-feature-name
```

### Code Quality Standards

**Haskell Style:**

- Four-space indentation
- `HsJupyter.*` module namespace
- Total functions preferred over partial
- Haddock comments for public APIs

**Testing Requirements:**

- Unit tests for all new modules
- Integration tests for user-facing features
- Property-based testing for pure functions
- Golden tests for protocol compatibility

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
cabal v2-test all

# Specific test suites  
cabal v2-test unit                    # 38+ unit tests
cabal v2-test integration            # 12+ integration tests
cabal v2-test unit -t SessionStateSpec  # Individual test file

# With detailed output
cabal v2-test unit --test-show-details=streaming
```

### Performance Profiling

```bash
# Runtime memory profiling
cabal v2-run hs-jupyter-kernel +RTS -s

# Execution time profiling  
cabal v2-run hs-jupyter-kernel +RTS -p

# Heap profiling
cabal v2-run hs-jupyter-kernel +RTS -h -i0.1
```

## Runtime Queue Usage

### Basic Execution

```haskell
import HsJupyter.Runtime.Manager

-- Setup runtime with resource limits
let budget = ResourceBudget
      { rbMaxMemoryMB = 512
      , rbMaxCpuSeconds = 30.0  
      , rbMaxOutputBytes = 1048576
      }

withRuntimeManager budget 5 $ \manager -> do
  let ctx = ExecuteContext "cell-001" 1 (object [])
      metadata = JobMetadata timestamp correlationId
  
  -- Submit for execution
  outcome <- submitExecute manager ctx metadata "let x = 42"
  
  case outcomeStatus outcome of
    ExecutionOk -> putStrLn "Success!"
    ExecutionError -> putStrLn "Failed!"
    ExecutionAbort -> putStrLn "Cancelled!"
```

### Advanced Queue Management

```haskell
-- Custom resource limits
let strictLimits = ResourceLimits
      { rcMaxCpuSeconds = 5.0      -- 5 second timeout
      , rcMaxMemoryMB = 128        -- 128MB limit
      , rcMaxOutputBytes = 10240   -- 10KB output
      , rcCpuMode = CpuUser        -- User CPU time only
      , rcMemoryMode = MemoryResident
      }

-- Higher concurrency for batch processing
withRuntimeManager customBudget 20 $ \manager -> do
  -- Process multiple cells concurrently
  outcomes <- mapConcurrently (submitExecute manager ctx metadata) codes
  return outcomes
```

## Cancellation Flags

### Implementing Cancellation-Aware Code

```haskell
-- In evaluation engine
evaluateWithCancellation :: TMVar () -> Text -> IO (Maybe Text)
evaluateWithCancellation cancelToken code = do
  -- Check cancellation before expensive operation
  cancelled <- checkCancellation cancelToken
  if cancelled 
    then return Nothing
    else do
      -- Perform computation...
      result <- expensiveComputation code
      
      -- Check again after computation
      cancelled' <- checkCancellation cancelToken  
      if cancelled'
        then return Nothing
        else return (Just result)

checkCancellation :: TMVar () -> IO Bool
checkCancellation token = atomically $ do
  result <- tryReadTMVar token
  return $ isJust result
```

### Cancellation Best Practices

1. **Check Early and Often**: Add cancellation checks before expensive operations
2. **Granular Checking**: Check every few hundred milliseconds in loops
3. **Clean Shutdown**: Ensure resources are released on cancellation
4. **State Consistency**: Don't leave session state in inconsistent state

```haskell
-- Good: Cancellation-aware loop
processItems :: TMVar () -> [Item] -> IO [Result]
processItems cancelToken items = go items []
  where
    go [] acc = return (reverse acc)
    go (x:xs) acc = do
      cancelled <- checkCancellation cancelToken
      if cancelled
        then return (reverse acc)  -- Partial results OK
        else do
          result <- processItem x
          go xs (result:acc)
```

## Resource Tuning

### Memory Management

```haskell
-- For memory-intensive workloads
let memoryHeavyLimits = defaultResourceLimits
      { rcMaxMemoryMB = 2048      -- 2GB limit
      , rcMemoryMode = MemoryResident
      }

-- For memory-constrained environments  
let memoryConstrainedLimits = defaultResourceLimits
      { rcMaxMemoryMB = 256       -- 256MB limit
      , rcMemoryMode = MemoryVirtual
      }
```

### CPU Time Limits

```haskell
-- For compute-heavy tasks
let computeHeavyLimits = defaultResourceLimits
      { rcMaxCpuSeconds = 120.0   -- 2 minute limit
      , rcCpuMode = CpuUser       -- User time only
      }

-- For interactive use
let interactiveLimits = defaultResourceLimits
      { rcMaxCpuSeconds = 5.0     -- 5 second limit  
      , rcCpuMode = CpuWall       -- Wall clock time
      }
```

### Output Management

```haskell
-- For data analysis (large outputs)
let dataAnalysisLimits = defaultResourceLimits
      { rcMaxOutputBytes = 10485760  -- 10MB output
      }

-- For embedded use (minimal outputs)
let embeddedLimits = defaultResourceLimits
      { rcMaxOutputBytes = 4096      -- 4KB output
      }
```

### Monitoring Configuration

```haskell
-- Fine-grained monitoring
let preciseConfig = ResourceConfig
      { rgLimits = defaultResourceLimits
      , rgEnforcement = True
      , rgMonitoringInterval = 0.05   -- 50ms checks
      }

-- Coarse-grained monitoring (lower overhead)
let efficientConfig = ResourceConfig  
      { rgLimits = defaultResourceLimits
      , rgEnforcement = True
      , rgMonitoringInterval = 1.0    -- 1 second checks
      }
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Queue Capacity Exceeded:**

```text
RuntimeManagerException: Queue capacity (5) exceeded
```

- Increase queue capacity in `withRuntimeManager`
- Implement backpressure in client code
- Consider batching or rate limiting

**Memory Limit Violations:**

```text
ResourceViolation: MemoryViolation 1024 512
```

- Increase `rcMaxMemoryMB` limit
- Check for memory leaks in evaluation code
- Profile with `+RTS -h` for heap analysis

**Timeout Errors:**

```text
ResourceViolation: TimeoutViolation 35.2 30.0
```

- Increase `rcMaxCpuSeconds` for long computations
- Add cancellation checks in evaluation loops
- Consider breaking work into smaller chunks

### Debugging Techniques

**STM Deadlock Detection:**

```bash
# Run with STM debugging
cabal v2-run hs-jupyter-kernel +RTS -xc
```

**Resource Monitoring:**

```haskell
-- Add custom telemetry
import HsJupyter.Runtime.Telemetry

logResourceUsage :: ResourceGuard -> IO ()
logResourceUsage guard = do
  stats <- getRTSStats  
  emitMetric "memory.allocated" (allocated_bytes stats)
  emitMetric "memory.live" (live_bytes stats)
```

**Cancellation Debugging:**

```haskell
-- Log cancellation events
debugCancellation :: TMVar () -> Text -> IO ()
debugCancellation token context = do
  cancelled <- atomically $ tryReadTMVar token
  case cancelled of
    Just _ -> putStrLn $ "CANCELLED: " <> T.unpack context
    Nothing -> return ()
```

## Performance Guidelines

### Runtime Manager Optimization

- Use appropriate queue capacity (2-10x CPU cores)
- Monitor queue depth to detect bottlenecks
- Consider work-stealing for CPU-bound tasks

### Session State Efficiency  

- Minimize binding storage size
- Lazy evaluation for module artifacts
- Periodic garbage collection of unused bindings

### Resource Guard Tuning

- Balance monitoring frequency vs overhead
- Use appropriate timeout granularity
- Consider async monitoring for high-throughput scenarios

   xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /path/to/hs-jupyter-kernel
   ```

2. **Use Homebrew paths:**

   ```bash
   export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
   hs-jupyter-kernel install
   ```

### Diagnostic and Logging

#### Enable verbose logging

```bash
# Environment variable
export HSJUPYTER_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Command line
hs-jupyter-kernel install --verbose

# Save logs
hs-jupyter-kernel doctor --report debug-report.json
```

#### Collect system information

```bash
# Full system diagnostic
hs-jupyter-kernel doctor --verbose --json > full-diagnostic.json

# Include system info
uname -a >> diagnostic-info.txt
ghc --version >> diagnostic-info.txt
jupyter --version >> diagnostic-info.txt
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### Manual kernel registration

If automatic installation fails:

```bash
# Create kernel directory
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/haskell

# Create kernel.json
cat > ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/haskell/kernel.json << EOF
{
  "argv": ["/path/to/hs-jupyter-kernel", "--kernel"],
  "display_name": "Haskell",
  "language": "haskell",
  "metadata": {
    "debugger": false
  }
}
EOF
```

#### Test kernel communication

```python
# test_kernel.py
import jupyter_client
import json

# Test kernel manager
km = jupyter_client.KernelManager(kernel_name='haskell')
km.start_kernel()

# Test execution
kc = km.client()
msg_id = kc.execute('putStrLn "Hello World"')
reply = kc.get_shell_msg(timeout=10)

print("Kernel response:", json.dumps(reply, indent=2))

# CLI Architecture Documentation

**Feature**: Installation & CLI Infrastructure  
**Created**: 2025-01-28  
**Status**: In Development

## Overview

The HsJupyter CLI extends the existing kernel executable with installation and management commands while preserving the original kernel server functionality.

## Architecture Decisions

### Command Dispatch Strategy

The CLI uses argument-based mode detection in `app/KernelMain.hs`:

- **Kernel Server Mode**: Default behavior when no CLI commands detected
- **CLI Command Mode**: Activated by recognized subcommands (`install`, `doctor`, `uninstall`, `list`, `version`)

### Module Organization

Following constitutional patterns with clear separation of concerns:

```text
src/HsJupyter/CLI/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Commands.hs         # Command parsing and dispatch
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Types.hs           # Core data models and error types  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Install.hs         # Installation logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Doctor.hs          # Diagnostic functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Config.hs          # Configuration management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ System.hs          # System integration utilities
```

### Constitutional Integration

All CLI functionality integrates with existing constitutional framework:

- **Error Handling**: Extends `RuntimeDiagnostic` system
- **Observability**: Uses existing `katip` structured logging
- **Resource Management**: Integrates with `ResourceGuard` patterns
- **Cancellation**: Supports `TMVar`-based cancellation

## Design Principles

### 1. Backward Compatibility

The kernel server functionality remains unchanged. Users can continue using:

```bash
hs-jupyter-kernel --connection connection.json
```

### 2. Constitutional Compliance

All CLI code follows established patterns:
- Modular architecture with SOLID principles
- DRY error handling through shared utilities
- Comprehensive logging and observability
- Defensive programming with input validation

### 3. Cross-Platform Support

CLI operations work across Linux, macOS, and Windows:
- Use `System.FilePath` for path operations
- Handle platform-specific Jupyter installations
- Support various Python environments (conda, pip, system)

# HsJupyter Architecture Overview

This document outlines a lean, modular architecture for a high-performance Haskell Jupyter kernel. The design emphasises DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles while keeping room for future scalability.

## High-Level Flow

1. `KernelProcess` boots, loads configuration, and wires logging/metrics. See `src/HsJupyter/KernelProcess.hs` and CLI in `app/KernelMain.hs`.
2. `JupyterBridge` binds ZeroMQ sockets, validates envelopes, and produces typed protocol events. See `src/HsJupyter/Bridge/JupyterBridge.hs` plus `Protocol.{Envelope,Codec}`.
3. `RequestRouter` dispatches each event to a capability handler (execute, complete, inspect, etc.). Current scaffold at `src/HsJupyter/Router/RequestRouter.hs`.
4. `RuntimeManager` evaluates Haskell code through a persistent GHC session and streams outputs. See `src/HsJupyter/Runtime/{Manager,GHCSession,GHCRuntime,Evaluation}.hs`.
5. Results flow back through `JupyterBridge` as structured Jupyter messages.

The same pipeline handles control messages (interrupt, shutdown) and capability-specific flows such as completions and widgets.

- Contribution and security policies for upstream client: <https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>, <https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/blob/main/SECURITY.md>

## Core Components

### KernelProcess

- Parses CLI arguments, resolves configuration (`HsJupyter.Config`).
- Starts structured logging (e.g. katip/co-log) with per-message correlation IDs.
- Supervises worker threads and ensures graceful teardown on failure.

### JupyterBridge

- Owns ZeroMQ sockets for shell, iopub, control, stdin channels.
- Prototype module lives at `src/HsJupyter/Bridge/JupyterBridge.hs`, binding ZeroMQ sockets, verifying HMAC signatures, and translating multipart frames into typed envelopes for the Phase 1 echo runtime.
- Provides codec layer via `src/HsJupyter/Bridge/Protocol/{Envelope,Codec}.hs` with typed message records, avoiding ad-hoc JSON handling.
- Validates signatures, message order, and routing metadata before passing requests to the router.
- Serialises replies/outputs from typed data back into Jupyter wire format.

### RequestRouter

- Routes decoded events to capability handlers registered in a `CapabilityRegistry`.
- Keeps concerns separated: execution, completions, inspections, diagnostics, widgets.
- Normalises cancellation, deadlines, and error propagation.

### RuntimeManager

- Wraps a long-lived GHC session (via `hint`), implemented across `GHCSession`, `GHCRuntime`, and `Evaluation` modules.
- Compiles cells incrementally, tracks module state in `DynamicScope`, and exposes soft resets.
- Streams stdout/stderr via callbacks; collects rich results into `ExecutionOutcome`.
- Enforces resource limits in cooperation with `RuntimeSupervisor`.

### RuntimeSupervisor & JobQueue

- Maintains a bounded `TBQueue` of `CellJob` items to prevent overload.
- Runs jobs in async workers, tagging them with parent message IDs to simplify cancellation.
- Emits runtime metrics (latency, queue depth, memory) for observability.

## Supporting Services

### EnvironmentService

- Detects Stack/Cabal projects or bare GHC environments.
- Creates hashed sandboxes in `~/.cache/hsjupyter/<ghc-version>/<hash>` to reuse compiled artifacts.
- Prefers prebuilt runtime bundles shipped with releases; falls back to building from source only when custom dependencies are requested.
- Exposes per-notebook dependency resolution while keeping execution layer agnostic of tooling specifics.

### Capability Providers

- `CompletionProvider`: integrates with HLS APIs or `ghci :complete`, caches symbol tables per scope.
- `DiagnosticsProvider`: maps compilation/runtime errors into structured diagnostics with source spans.
- `WidgetServer`: manages comm targets and widget state, synchronises frontend/back-end lifecycle events.
- `ResourceMonitor`: samples CPU/memory usage, can issue warnings or throttle execution.

### Persistence & Caching

- `SessionStore` (SQLite or JSON) persists notebook metadata, environment hashes, widget state.
- `ArtifactCache` stores compiled modules/object files for faster cold starts.
- Both stores remain optional to keep stateless deployments straightforward.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- Config managed via lightweight `ReaderT Env` stack; services depend on minimal typeclasses (`MonadRuntime`, `MonadBridge`) to keep modules testable.
- Structured logging and metrics instrumentation at boundaries (bridge, router, runtime).
- Error handling centralised in `ExecutionOutcome` to translate exceptions into user-friendly diagnostics.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for protocol codecs, renderers, and environment hashing.
- Property tests verifying message round-trips and cache determinism.
- Integration tests driven by `nbclient` executing golden notebooks and asserting message sequences.
- Load tests to validate supervisor throttling under concurrent execution.

## Implementation Milestones

1. **Bootstrap**: skeleton Cabal project, placeholder modules, build pipeline (CI + formatter + hlint).
2. **Bridge Prototype**: implement `KernelProcess` + `JupyterBridge` loop; round-trip `execute_request` returning a fixed reply.
3. **Runtime Integration**: hook in `RuntimeManager`, stream stdout/stderr, map errors to diagnostics.
4. **Capabilities**: add completions, inspections, widgets behind feature flags to avoid premature complexity.
5. **Performance Hardening**: enable artifact caching, introduce monitoring endpoints, run load tests.
6. **Distribution Pipeline**: automate building signed binaries, packaging precompiled dependency bundles, and running the bootstrap installer end-to-end in CI.

## Installation & Distribution

- **Prebuilt releases**: publish statically linked binaries (one per major platform) bundled with the kernel spec so users run a single installer without compiling dependencies.
- **Curated package set**: ship a frozen snapshot of core libraries (`.cabal.project.freeze` or Stack snapshot) and reuse precompiled artifacts stored in release assets to avoid repeated package builds.
- **Bootstrap script**: provide a lightweight installer (`hsjupyter install`) that detects existing GHC (via GHCup), downloads the matching runtime bundle, installs the kernel spec, and verifies health‚Äîno manual Stack/Cabal steps.
- **Portable archive**: offer a zip/tarball containing the binary, kernel spec, and default config for offline installs; include hooks so users can override the runtime path if they already have GHC.
- **Container & Nix paths**: maintain Docker images and a Nix flake for reproducibility, but keep them optional so the simplest path is still a single download.

## User Experience Goals

- First-run target: from download to executing a notebook cell in <5 minutes on a clean machine.
- Zero-compilation experience for default installation paths; prebuilt artifacts must cover mainstream platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux).
- Installer outputs actionable guidance (e.g. missing Jupyter) with copy-paste fixes and retry instructions.
- Upgrades preserve user kernels and cached environments without manual cleanup.

## Bootstrap Installer Blueprint

1. Detect prerequisites: check for Jupyter, Python, and GHC installations; offer to install or point to documentation if missing.
2. Select runtime bundle: choose the prebuilt archive matching OS + GHC version; download with checksum validation.
3. Lay down files: extract binary, config, and kernel spec into user-level directories (`~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/hsjupyter`).
4. Register cache: populate artifact cache directory and record metadata for future updates.
5. Health check: run a smoke test notebook via `nbclient` to confirm execution path.
6. Telemetry (opt-in): optionally report anonymous install success/failure to improve bundles.
7. Provide uninstall command that cleans binaries, kernel spec, caches, and keeps user notebooks untouched.

### Installer UX Flow

- Entry: `hsjupyter install` displays summary of actions, asks for consent, and supports `--yes` for automation.
- Prerequisite resolver prints detected versions; missing tools accompanied by direct download commands.
- Progress output uses concise status lines (`[1/5] Downloading runtime bundle‚Ä¶`), with retry logic and checksum verification feedback.
- Post-install summary includes kernel spec path, cache location, and command to launch JupyterLab; exposes `--diagnose` flag to run extra checks.
- Uninstall path mirrors UX with `hsjupyter uninstall`, providing dry-run diff before deleting files.
- Internationalisation kept simple: structured messages ready for future translation without hard-coding text in CLI logic.

## Release Workflow

- Versioning: semantic versioning with synchronized tags across binary, runtime bundles, and installer.
- Continuous integration: matrix builds on CI (Linux/macOS/Windows) producing signed binaries, runtime bundles, and checksum manifests.
- Quality gates: automated smoke notebooks, lint/test suites, and installer E2E tests within CI before release promotion.
- Distribution: publish assets to GitHub Releases plus a lightweight CDN for bootstrap downloads; update hash manifest consumed by the installer.
- Documentation cadence: release notes summarizing features/fixes, upgrade instructions, and compatibility matrix.

## Maintenance & Support

- Long-term support branches for the latest two minor versions, receiving security fixes and critical bug patches.
- Scheduled GHC compatibility reviews (e.g. quarterly) with decision logs for dropping old compilers.
- Bug triage rotation with response-time targets; template reproductions to keep issue reports actionable.
- Diagnostics command (`hsjupyter doctor`) collecting environment info and recent logs to simplify support workflows.

### `hsjupyter doctor` Specification

- Collects versions (HsJupyter, GHC, Python, Jupyter, OS) and prints them in a machine-readable table.
- Validates runtime bundle integrity (checksum, timestamp) and reports missing artifacts.
- Runs optional notebook smoke test with `--run-smoke`; provides guidance if execution fails.
- Scrubs sensitive data (home paths, environment secrets) before saving optional support bundle (zip of logs + summary).
- Exit codes: `0` for healthy, `10` for warnings (e.g. outdated bundle), `20` for failures (missing dependencies).
- Integrates with bootstrap installer so users can run diagnosis immediately after failed installs.

## Deployment & Ops

- Distribute update notifications via the bootstrap tool; allow delta updates so users avoid re-downloading large packages.
- Ship Docker images bundling JupyterLab + HsJupyter for zero-config demos.
- Expose metrics (EKG/Prometheus) and structured logs to integrate with user observability stacks.

## Risk & Mitigation

- **Slow installs**: mitigate with prebuilt artifacts and delta updates; monitor installer telemetry for regressions.
- **Binary incompatibilities**: incorporate nightly smoke runs across supported OS/GHC combinations; rollback plan via manifest pinning.
- **Protocol drift**: track Jupyter kernel spec updates in automated checks; fail builds when schema diverges.
- **Resource exhaustion**: enforce supervisor limits and provide configuration knobs for memory/timeouts; document tuning recipes.

## Configuration & Customisation

- Configuration hierarchy: default config baked into binary ‚Üí system-wide overrides (e.g. `/etc/hsjupyter/config.toml`) ‚Üí user config (`~/.config/hsjupyter/config.toml`) ‚Üí per-notebook metadata.
- Configured via TOML with schema validation; environment variables offer quick overrides (`HSJUPYTER_LOG_LEVEL`, `HSJUPYTER_RUNTIME_PATH`).
- Kernel spec metadata exposes toggleable capabilities (widgets, completions) without editing config files.
- Provide `hsjupyter config edit` helper to open user config in editor with comments explaining options.
- Document safe defaults for resource limits, telemetry, and diagnostics to ensure predictable behaviour.

## Roadmap Timeline (Indicative)

- **Phase 0 ‚Äì Foundations (Weeks 1-2)**: set up repository, CI, coding standards, scaffolding for core modules, initial architecture diagrams.
- **Phase 1 ‚Äì Protocol Bridge (Weeks 3-4)**: implement `KernelProcess`, `JupyterBridge`, typed protocol models, and minimal execute echo path; deliver first integration demo.
- **Phase 2 ‚Äì Runtime Core (Weeks 5-7)**: integrate persistent GHC session, streaming outputs, cancellation, and baseline diagnostics; run real notebooks.
- **Phase 3 ‚Äì Capabilities & UX (Weeks 8-10)**: add completions, inspections, widget support, logging/metrics polish; introduce `hsjupyter doctor`.
- **Phase 4 ‚Äì Distribution (Weeks 11-12)**: build bootstrap installer, package prebuilt artifacts, exercise E2E install tests across platforms.
- **Phase 5 ‚Äì Hardening & Release (Weeks 13-14)**: performance profiling, load testing, documentation finalisation, publish release candidates, gather beta feedback.

## CI & Release Automation Blueprint

- CI stages: `lint` ‚Üí `unit-tests` ‚Üí `integration-tests` ‚Üí `build-binaries` ‚Üí `package-bundles` ‚Üí `installer-e2e`.
- Use GitHub Actions workflows with reusable jobs; caches GHC toolchains via GHCup actions; caches cabal/store directories keyed by snapshot hash.
- Binary signing performed in dedicated job using hardware-backed secrets (e.g. cosign or codesign on macOS); artifacts notarised where required.
- Nightly builds on `main` channel update a `nightly` manifest consumed by optional bleeding-edge installers.
- Release promotion pipeline triggered by tagging: runs full suite plus manual approval gate before publishing artifacts and updating release notes.
- Post-release job pushes documentation updates and notifies bootstrap manifest CDN to ensure new hashes propagate.

## Telemetry & Privacy

- Installer telemetry opt-in by default off; prompt explains data collected (anonymised OS, install success/failure, durations).
- Runtime telemetry focuses on anonymised metrics (latency, errors) using hashed identifiers; supports `--no-telemetry` flag and config toggle.
- Data retention policy: aggregate metrics retained for 90 days; raw logs discarded unless user provides support bundle.
- Publish privacy statement and data schema; include `hsjupyter telemetry status` command for transparency.
- Ensure telemetry paths work offline by queuing events locally and discarding after expiry‚Äîno failures when network unavailable.

## Community & Contribution

- CONTRIBUTING guide outlines coding standards, review expectations, and CLA (if any).
- Decision log (`docs/decisions/ADR-XXXX.md`) documents major architectural choices to keep contributors aligned.
- Governance model: maintainers group with documented release permissions; onboarding checklist for new maintainers.
- Encourage community kernels/extensions via capability interfaces; provide examples in `docs/examples/community`.
- Regular community sync (monthly) to review roadmap, gather feedback, and highlight contributors.

## Support Operations

- Tiered support model: community support via GitHub Discussions, issue tracker triaged by maintainers, escalations handled through dedicated email/contact.
- SLA targets: community responses within 48 hours, critical bugs acknowledged within 24 hours, patches scoped within 5 business days when feasible.
- Support playbooks stored in `docs/support/` covering common install issues, runtime diagnostics, and workarounds; kept in sync with `hsjupyter doctor` outputs.
- Incident response checklist for outages (e.g. broken installer manifest) including rollback steps, communication templates, and post-mortem workflow.
- Knowledge base curated from repeated issues, linked in installer/doctor messages to deflect known pain points.

## Security & Compliance

- Threat modelling: identify attack surfaces (ZeroMQ sockets, notebook inputs, installer downloads) and document mitigations.
- Code execution sandboxing: run user code in controlled OS processes with resource limits; optional seccomp profile for Linux containers.
- Signed release assets with reproducible builds; verify signatures in bootstrap installer before unpacking.
- Handle secrets carefully: redact environment variables in logs, require explicit opt-in to expose credentials.
- Security response plan: dedicated contact, 90-day disclosure policy, and CVE issuance process where applicable.
- Dependency scanning (Cabal audit, GitHub Dependabot/Nix advisories) integrated into CI; failing builds block releases until patched.

## Observability Strategy

- Logging: structured JSON logs with correlation IDs; log levels configurable per component; default redaction of sensitive data.
- Metrics: expose Prometheus-compatible endpoint with counters (executions, errors), histograms (latency, compile time), gauges (memory usage).
- Tracing: optional OpenTelemetry integration capturing execution spans (bridge receive ‚Üí runtime evaluate ‚Üí bridge send) for deep debugging.
- Dashboard templates provided (Grafana, CloudWatch) so operators can import observability setup quickly.
- Alerting recommendations: thresholds for queue depth, execute latency, installer failure rate; integrate with PagerDuty/Opsgenie if desired.
- Provide `hsjupyter observe collect` command to bundle recent logs/metrics snapshots for support scenarios.

## Performance Targets

- Cold start (first cell) < 6 seconds on mainstream laptops; warm cell execution < 300 ms for simple expressions.
- Installer runtime < 2 minutes on broadband connections with cached bundles; < 10 minutes on fresh download.
- Memory footprint: idle kernel < 200 MB, active notebook < 600 MB; document tuning options.
- Concurrency: handle at least 4 parallel execute requests with predictable latency; degrade gracefully beyond that using queue backpressure.
- Widget responsiveness: UI updates propagate within 200 ms round-trip under normal load.
- Publish benchmark suite measuring these targets; run in CI to track regressions.

### Benchmarking Plan

- Tooling: use Criterion for microbenchmarks (expression evaluation), custom notebook harness for macro metrics, and hyperfine for installer timing.
- Scenarios: cold start (fresh cache), warm start (cache primed), heavy notebook (data/plotting), concurrent cells, widget interactions.
- Environment: define reference hardware/software profiles; run on CI plus dedicated performance machines for consistency.
- Reporting: store results in `docs/performance/benchmarks.json` with historical comparisons; flag regressions above defined thresholds.
- Automation: nightly performance pipeline executes benchmark suite, publishes trend charts, and creates alerts for significant deviations.

## Testing Matrix

- Platforms: Windows (x64/ARM64), macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), Linux (Ubuntu LTS, Fedora).
- GHC versions: latest LTS, previous minor, and Long-Term Support release; document unsupported combinations.
- Jupyter environments: classic Notebook, JupyterLab, VS Code notebooks; smoke tested via automation.
- Feature paths: execution, completions, widgets, diagnostics, installer install/uninstall, doctor tool.
- Accessibility tests: verify screen readers on macOS VoiceOver and NVDA, contrast checks for outputs.
- Track matrix coverage via CI dashboard with pass/fail history and flaky test alerts.

## Documentation Roadmap

- `README`: concise overview, quickstart, and link to installer instructions.
- `docs/architecture.md`: living document updated every milestone; add diagrams (component, sequence, deployment).
- `docs/installation/*`: platform-specific guides, troubleshooting, and FAQ.
- `docs/reference/configuration.md`: detailed config options with examples and schema definitions.
- `docs/developer/*`: contribution guide, coding standards, ADR index, testing walkthroughs.
- `docs/releases/*`: changelog, upgrade notes, compatibility matrix; generated during release pipeline.
- Plan documentation sprints aligned with major milestones to ensure docs ship in lockstep with features.

## Support Knowledge Base

- Structure topics by lifecycle: Installation, Runtime, Widgets, Environment, Troubleshooting, FAQ.
- Each article template includes symptoms, root cause, quick fix, long-term mitigation, and links to related docs.
- Integrate with `hsjupyter doctor` outputs (error codes map to KB articles) and installer guidance.
- Provide community contribution process for KB entries (review checklist, approval workflow).
- Host KB in `docs/support/kb` with static site generator (e.g., mkdocs) for searchable web docs.

## Accessibility Roadmap

- Conduct accessibility audit alongside Phase 3 to identify gaps in Jupyter integration, messaging clarity, and keyboard navigation.
- Ensure CLI tools (`install`, `doctor`) support screen readers (aria-friendly output) and high-contrast terminal themes.
- Provide alternative text for generated visual outputs and expose hooks for tactile/sonification tools where possible.
- Collaborate with accessibility testers to validate widget interactions; document best practices for notebook authors.
- Publish accessibility statement outlining compliance targets (WCAG 2.1 AA) and progress, updated each release.

## Localization Strategy

- Internationalise CLI messages by storing strings in locale files (e.g., JSON or gettext); default English, community-driven translations.
- Allow kernel metadata (display name, help text) to be localized via config.
- Documentation translation plan: prioritise quickstart and troubleshooting pages; leverage community translation sprints with review process.
- Support locale detection from environment variables while allowing `--locale` override for CLI tools.
- Ensure telemetry and diagnostics handle Unicode paths and messages reliably.

## Licensing & Compliance

- Project licensed under Apache 2.0 (or preferred permissive license); include SPDX headers in source files.
- Dependency license scanning as part of CI, generating attribution reports for release artifacts.
- Provide third-party notice file bundled with binaries; include guidance for commercial usage.
- Document export compliance stance (e.g., no encryption beyond standard HTTPS) and confirm compatibility with target regions.
- Maintain contributor license agreements or Developer Certificate of Origin workflow aligned with governance model.

## Ethical & Legal Considerations

- Clearly communicate that notebook code executes locally and retains user responsibility; highlight risks around executing untrusted notebooks.
- Provide guidelines for handling sensitive data in notebooks and discourage storing credentials in plain text cells.
- Respect user privacy by keeping telemetry optional and anonymised; document data usage policies prominently.
- Ensure documentation and community guidelines foster inclusive language and respectful collaboration.
- Review third-party dependencies for known ethical concerns (e.g., licensing conflicts, vulnerable packages) during dependency audits.

## Sustainability & Funding

- Outline potential funding models (donations, sponsorships, grants) to support maintenance and infrastructure costs.
- Maintain transparent expense reports if funds are managed; allocate budget for CI runners, hosting, and accessibility testing.
- Encourage contributor growth through mentorship programs and pairing sessions; track contributor retention metrics.
- Explore partnerships with academic or industrial groups using Haskell notebooks to share maintenance load.
- Periodically reassess project scope against available resources, pruning non-essential features to avoid maintainer burnout.

## Integration Roadmap

- Identify key integrations: JupyterLab extensions, nbconvert exporters, Haskell language server adapters, data viz libraries (VegaLite, Chart).
- Plan progressive integration milestones (e.g., basic HLS integration in Phase 3, advanced tooling post-launch).
- Document APIs/hooks for third-party tools to extend the kernel (custom display renderers, notebook magics).
- Collaborate with upstream Jupyter and Haskell ecosystem projects to align roadmaps and avoid duplication.
- Track integration requests from community feedback, prioritising those with broad impact.

## Release Communication

- Pre-release: publish beta notes, invite testers via newsletter/social channels; highlight testing focus areas.
- Launch: coordinated announcement (blog, mailing list, social posts) with clear upgrade instructions and headline features.
- Post-release: collect feedback via surveys, track adoption metrics, and publish follow-up posts if hotfixes required.
- Maintain public roadmap board showing upcoming milestones and status to keep community engaged.
- Document communication templates in `docs/releases/templates` for consistency across releases.

## Open Questions & Future Work

- Choose between `hint` and direct GHC API for runtime‚Äîprototype both to compare performance and complexity.
- Evaluate feasibility of WebAssembly compilation for running Haskell code in browser-backed Jupyter clients.
- Investigate distributed execution (remote runtimes, Kubernetes integration) once single-host path stabilises.
- Determine long-term packaging strategy for Windows ARM and Apple Silicon universal binaries.
- Plan accessibility features (screen-reader friendly outputs, high-contrast themes) for notebook interactions.

## Next Steps

- Finalise interfaces for core modules (`HsJupyter.Bridge`, `HsJupyter.Runtime`, `HsJupyter.Capabilities`).
- Prototype bridge ‚Üî runtime handshake to validate ZeroMQ framing and GHC session management.
- Iterate documentation as implementation details solidify, keeping diagrams and sequence charts in sync with the code.

- [X] T003 [P] Add base directory structure (`app/`, `src/HsJupyter/`, `test/`, `scripts/demo/`) with placeholder modules so cabal builds succeed.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core protocol and configuration components that all user stories rely on.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete.

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready ‚Äì user story implementation can now begin in parallel.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Complete Execute Echo (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Demonstrate end-to-end execute echo loop from nbclient through the kernel with control-channel interrupt handling.

**Independent Test**: Run `scripts/demo/phase1_echo_notebook.py --connection scripts/demo/sample-connection.json` and observe `status=ok` plus streamed stdout within 2 seconds.

### Tests for User Story 1 ‚ö†Ô∏è Write before implementation

- [X] T012 [US1] Wire ZeroMQ sockets, signature verification hook, and reply emission in `src/HsJupyter/Bridge/JupyterBridge.hs` (happy-path only).
- [X] T013 [US1] Bootstrap kernel lifecycle in `app/KernelMain.hs`, invoking `KernelProcess` startup, bridge loop, and graceful shutdown.

**Checkpoint**: Execute echo path demonstrably round-trips and control interrupts return `ok` without crashing the kernel.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Enforced Protocol Guardrails (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Reject unsigned or malformed envelopes while keeping valid traffic unaffected.

**Independent Test**: Replay a bad HMAC using the demo harness and confirm the kernel logs `invalid_signature` while subsequent valid messages succeed.

### Tests for User Story 2 ‚ö†Ô∏è Write before implementation

- [X] T014 [P] [US2] Add negative-path spec `test/unit/SignatureValidationSpec.hs` that feeds invalid HMACs and asserts drop + warning behaviour.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T015 [US2] Extend `src/HsJupyter/Bridge/JupyterBridge.hs` to enforce HMAC checks, emit structured warnings, and maintain socket health after drops.
- [X] T016 [US2] Add guardrail telemetry in `src/HsJupyter/KernelProcess.hs` (or dedicated metrics module) tracking rejected message counts.

**Checkpoint**: Malformed envelopes are detected, dropped, and logged without interrupting valid message flow.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Operability Insights (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Provide baseline diagnostics (logs + heartbeat metrics) for on-call operators.

**Independent Test**: Launch kernel with `HSJUPYTER_LOG_LEVEL=debug` and confirm heartbeat latency + correlation IDs in logs while the demo runs.

### Tests for User Story 3 ‚ö†Ô∏è Write before implementation

- [X] T020 [US3] Surface metrics/log configuration options in `app/KernelMain.hs` and document environment toggles in `docs/developer/README.md`.

**Checkpoint**: Debug logging provides actionable metadata and heartbeat monitoring meets success criteria.

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Documentation, packaging, and quality pass across all user stories.

- [X] T021 [P] Update `quickstart.md` and `docs/architecture.md` to reflect implemented ZeroMQ flow and observability knobs.
- [X] T022 Consolidate sample connection files and demo assets in `scripts/demo/` with README updates.
- [X] T023 Run full `cabal v2-test` and record results in `specs/001-protocol-bridge/quickstart.md` troubleshooting section.
- [X] T024 [P] Prepare release notes snippet in `docs/roadmap.md` marking Phase 1 tasks complete.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)** ‚Üí prerequisite for all subsequent work.
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)** ‚Üí depends on Phase 1; blocks all user stories until complete.
- **Phase 3 (US1)** ‚Üí depends on Phase 2 completion; unlocks MVP demo.
- **Phase 4 (US2)** ‚Üí depends on Phase 2; may run after or alongside US1 once shared files stabilise.
- **Phase 5 (US3)** ‚Üí depends on Phase 2; can begin after US1 stabilises to avoid log schema churn.
- **Phase 6 (Polish)** ‚Üí depends on completion of targeted user stories (US1‚ÄìUS3).

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1** stands alone once foundational components exist.
- **US2** builds on US1‚Äôs bridge implementation but must keep guardrails isolated to avoid regressions.
- **US3** extends logging/heartbeat around the same bridge; coordinate sequencing to prevent merge conflicts.

### Within-Story Ordering

- Write and fail tests (T008, T009, T014, T017) before implementing behaviour.
- Implement runtime/bridge logic before wiring CLI bootstrap.
- Update documentation only after behaviour is validated.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Setup task T003 can run alongside cabal file authoring once filenames are final.
- Foundational tasks T005 and T006 can progress in parallel; both depend on T004 for config types.
- Within US1, T008 and T009 can progress concurrently while implementation waits for test scaffolds.
- US2‚Äôs telemetry task (T016) can progress once T015 establishes rejection hooks.
- US3 tasks T018‚ÄìT020 should run sequentially to avoid logging conflicts, but T017 can be authored in parallel.
- Polish tasks T021 and T024 can proceed in parallel after core stories complete.

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Parallel test scaffolding before implementation
- T008 [P] [US1] Create nbclient-driven round-trip test in test/integration/ExecuteEchoSpec.hs
- T009 [P] [US1] Implement demo harness scripts/demo/phase1_echo_notebook.py

# After tests exist, parallelise runtime and router work once interfaces agreed
- T010 [US1] Implement stub runtime echo behaviour in src/HsJupyter/Runtime/EchoRuntime.hs
- T011 [US1] Implement request routing in src/HsJupyter/Router/RequestRouter.hs
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1 + Phase 2 to establish buildable project foundation.
2. Execute Phase 3 tasks (T008‚ÄìT013) to deliver the execute echo demo.
3. Validate nbclient round-trip and control interrupt handling before expanding scope.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Deliver US1 (echo loop) as the Phase 1 milestone.
2. Layer US2 guardrails to harden the bridge without affecting US1 tests.
3. Add US3 observability enhancements to support operators and CI diagnostics.

### Parallel Team Strategy

- Developer A: Owns foundational protocol types (T004‚ÄìT007) and US1 runtime/bridge work (T010‚ÄìT013).
- Developer B: Focuses on guardrail validation and telemetry (T014‚ÄìT016).
- Developer C: Drives observability enhancements and heartbeat metrics (T017‚ÄìT020) plus polish documentation (T021‚ÄìT024).

---

## Notes

- Maintain sequential task IDs (T001‚ÄìT024) when updating progress.
- Mark completed tasks with `[X]` during implementation as required by `/speckit.implement`.
- Tests are front-loaded per story to preserve the constitution‚Äôs test-first gate.
- Re-run nbclient demo after each story to ensure independence and avoid regressions.
# Phase 1 Quickstart: Execute Echo Demo

## Prerequisites

- GHC 9.6.4 and cabal installed via `ghcup`.
- Python 3.11 with `pyzmq` installed (`python -m pip install pyzmq`).
- ZeroMQ library (`libzmq`) present on the system.

## Build Kernel Prototype

```bash
cabal v2-build hs-jupyter-kernel
```

## Launch Demo Harness

1. Start the kernel with the sample connection file (edit ports if needed):

   ```bash
   cabal v2-run hs-jupyter-kernel -- --connection scripts/demo/sample-connection.json --log-level debug
   ```

2. In another terminal, run the helper to send the execute request via pyzmq:

   ```bash
   scripts/demo/phase1_echo_notebook.py --connection scripts/demo/sample-connection.json
   ```

## Expected Results

- Demo helper sends a signed `execute_request` and prints the resulting `execute_reply` and stream frames.
- Run `cabal v2-test` to execute unit/integration suites (not run in this environment).
- Kernel logs show bound endpoints, message IDs, and heartbeat latency every 5 seconds.
- Introducing an invalid signature in the demo script (for example by editing the connection key) triggers a rejection log while sockets remain available.

## Troubleshooting

- If sockets fail to bind, verify the ports listed in the connection file are free.
- Missing ZeroMQ errors indicate `libzmq` headers or runtime are absent; reinstall via package manager (`brew install zeromq`, `apt install libzmq3-dev`).
- To inspect raw traffic, run the kernel with `HSJUPYTER_LOG_LEVEL=trace` to see frame-level dumps.

# Research Summary: Phase 1 ‚Äì Protocol Bridge

## Decision 1: ZeroMQ Binding

- **Decision**: Use `zeromq4-haskell` for socket management.
- **Rationale**: Mature binding exposing DEALER/ROUTER patterns, proven in prior kernels, supports CURVE/HMAC, and integrates with `async` for supervised threads.
- **Alternatives considered**: `hszmq` (older API, limited maintenance), FFI shim to libzmq via custom bindings (higher effort, less type safety).

## Decision 2: Structured Logging Stack

- **Decision**: Adopt `katip` for structured logging and metrics hooks.
- **Rationale**: Provides JSON logging with namespaces, supports thread-local contexts, aligns with architecture plan calling out katip/co-log, and offers sinks for stdout plus file rotation.
- **Alternatives considered**: `co-log` (lighter but less opinionated about structure), manual `aeson` logging (higher maintenance, no rotation helpers).

## Decision 3: Demo & Test Harness

- **Decision**: Drive acceptance tests with `nbclient` executing a golden notebook through the kernel.
- **Rationale**: nbclient matches the spec‚Äôs acceptance scenario, runs headless in CI, and exercises the full message loop required for Phase 1 success criteria.
- **Alternatives considered**: Custom Python harness using `jupyter_client` (more boilerplate), manual JupyterLab demos (not automatable, breaks doc-first mandate).

## Decision 4: Heartbeat Monitoring Strategy

- **Decision**: Implement heartbeat responder using a dedicated lightweight thread that logs latency metrics via `katip` gauges.
- **Rationale**: Keeps heartbeat responsiveness independent from execute routing, supports the success criterion for 30-minute stability, and surfaces diagnostics for on-call maintainers.
- **Alternatives considered**: Multiplex heartbeat on main bridge loop (risk of starvation under load), defer heartbeat metrics to later phases (conflicts with observability gate).

## Decision 5: Configuration Loading

- **Decision**: Parse connection files via `aeson` into `KernelProcessConfig` with validation guarding missing fields.
- **Rationale**: Ensures predictable bootstrap behaviour, allows extension for CLI overrides, and matches requirement to bind sockets before traffic.
- **Alternatives considered**: Shell-out to Python to parse JSON (introduces runtime dependency), hand-rolled parser (reinvents `aeson` decoding and complicates schema updates).
# Data Model: Phase 1 ‚Äì Protocol Bridge

## KernelProcessConfig

- **Fields**:
  - `connectionFile :: FilePath` ‚Äî path to JSON file issued by Jupyter launcher.
  - `transport :: Text` ‚Äî protocol (`tcp`, `ipc`).
  - `ip :: Text` ‚Äî bind address (e.g., `127.0.0.1`).
  - `signatureScheme :: Text` ‚Äî HMAC algorithm, defaults to `hmac-sha256`.
  - `key :: ByteString` ‚Äî shared secret for message signing (may be empty for testing).
  - `shellPort`, `iopubPort`, `stdinPort`, `hbPort`, `controlPort :: Int` ‚Äî channel ports.
  - `logLevel :: LogLevel` ‚Äî resolved from CLI/env overrides.
- **Relationships**: Provides startup configuration consumed by `KernelProcess` and shared with `JupyterBridge`.
- **Validation Rules**: Ports must be >0; signature scheme required when key non-empty; file must exist and contain required fields.

## ProtocolEnvelope

- **Fields**:
  - `identities :: [ByteString]` ‚Äî routing identities preserved on replies.
  - `header :: MessageHeader` ‚Äî typed header (message ID, username, session, msgType, version).
  - `parentHeader :: Maybe MessageHeader` ‚Äî parent message for replies.
  - `metadata :: Value` ‚Äî JSON metadata forwarded untouched.
  - `content :: Value` ‚Äî typed content decoded per message type.
  - `signature :: ByteString` ‚Äî HMAC digest verifying `header` through `content` frames.
- **Relationships**: Instances produced by `JupyterBridge`, consumed by `RequestRouter`, and re-encoded on outbound frames.
- **Validation Rules**: Signature must match computed digest; message order recorded in bridge logs; reject envelopes missing header fields.

## ExecutionOutcome

- **Fields**:
  - `status :: ExecuteStatus` ‚Äî `Ok` or `Error` for Phase 1 stub.
  - `payload :: Value` ‚Äî JSON payload for execute result (echoed input code).
  - `streams :: [StreamChunk]` ‚Äî stdout/stderr frames mirrored to IOPub.
  - `executionCount :: Int` ‚Äî incremented per execute request.
- **Relationships**: Produced by `EchoRuntime`, translated into protocol frames by `RequestRouter`.
- **Validation Rules**: Execution count must monotonically increase; payload echoes original source for traceability; stub emits deterministic stream entries.

## Auxiliary Types

- **MessageHeader**: includes `msgId`, `session`, `username`, `date`, `msgType`. Ensures RFC3339 timestamp parsing.
- **Channel**: enum (`Shell`, `IOPub`, `Control`, `Stdin`, `Heartbeat`) guiding socket routing.
- **HeartbeatStatus**: captures last probe timestamp and rolling latency to feed observability metrics.

## State Transitions

- `KernelProcess` lifecycle: `Uninitialised ‚Üí BindingSockets ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Draining ‚Üí Terminated` with graceful shutdown on control messages.
- `HeartbeatStatus`: `Healthy` (latency <= 500ms) ‚Üî `Degraded` (latency > 500ms) ‚Üí `Unresponsive` (> 5s, triggers warning log).

## Data Volume & Scale Assumptions

- Messages limited to < 1 MB per spec; backlog processed sequentially per channel.
- In-memory structures only; no persistence required in Phase 1.
# Implementation Plan: Phase 1 ‚Äì Protocol Bridge

**Branch**: `001-protocol-bridge` | **Date**: 2025-10-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-protocol-bridge/spec.md`

## Summary

Phase 1 delivers a demonstrable Jupyter protocol bridge: `KernelProcess` boots from a connection file, `JupyterBridge` validates envelopes, and a stub runtime echoes `execute_request` traffic back to clients. The milestone proves the ZeroMQ handshake, signature checks, and observability hooks needed for roadmap progress.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Haskell (GHC 9.6.4 via ghcup)
**Primary Dependencies**: `zeromq4-haskell` for sockets, `aeson` for JSON, `bytestring`/`text`, `katip` for structured logging
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory runtime stub only)
**Testing**: `hspec` with `hspec-wai` style helpers for protocol harness; nbclient smoke notebooks in CI
**Target Platform**: Linux and macOS developer workstations; CI containers
**Project Type**: Single backend service (kernel executable)
**Performance Goals**: Execute echo round-trip < 2s; heartbeat stability for 30 min soak
**Constraints**: Deterministic echo stub; deny unsigned envelopes; structured logs on every message
**Scale/Scope**: Single-kernel instance per notebook; designed for local development load

## Constitution Check

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Documentation-first: spec and plan must precede implementation | ‚úÖ | Spec drafted (`spec.md`), plan in progress. |
| Test-first mindset: define acceptance & soak tests before runtime work | ‚úÖ | Echo acceptance scenarios captured in spec; soak metric in success criteria. |
| Observability baseline required in earliest phase | ‚úÖ | Logging/metrics requirements listed in spec and plan summary. |

**Structure Decision**: Single executable kernel with modular `HsJupyter.*` namespace; scripts support manual demos; tests split into unit vs integration to mirror roadmap expectations.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations identified; additional complexity log not required for this phase.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0 ‚Äì Research Focus

- Confirm Haskell ZeroMQ binding (`zeromq4-haskell`) suitability and thread-safety guarantees.
- Select structured logging library compatible with asynchronous workers.
- Define demo workflow using nbclient for automated echoes.

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Design Deliverables

- Codify protocol data model (`ProtocolEnvelope`, channel enums, signature helpers).
- Document API contracts for execute echo and control interrupt flows.
- Capture manual quickstart for running the phase demo script against a Jupyter connection file.
- Update agent context with ZeroMQ/hspec learnings for future tasks.

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Handoff to Tasks

- `/speckit.tasks` will map user stories to implementation tasks once design artifacts land.

## Constitution Re-Check

Design artifacts (research, data model, contracts, quickstart) align with documentation-first and observability gates. No new violations detected; proceed to tasks once `/speckit.tasks` is ready.
# Feature Specification: Phase 1 ‚Äì Protocol Bridge

**Feature Branch**: `001-protocol-bridge`  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Phase 1 ‚Äì Protocol Bridge"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete Execute Echo (Priority: P1)

As a kernel maintainer I can boot the Phase 1 kernel and have an `execute_request` echoed to `execute_reply`/IOPub so stakeholders can see the protocol loop working end-to-end.

**Why this priority**: This is the minimum demonstrable value for the kernel; without it the project has no working artifact.

**Independent Test**: Use the documented Phase 1 demo command with a Jupyter connection file and observe an `execute_reply` with status `ok` plus streamed stdout in notebook logs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the kernel starts with a valid connection file, **When** nbclient sends `print("ok")`, **Then** the bridge emits matching IOPub outputs and returns an execute_reply with status `ok` within 2 seconds.
2. **Given** the kernel is serving the control channel, **When** Jupyter issues an interrupt, **Then** the bridge acknowledges on control and the kernel process remains healthy.

---

### User Story 2 - Enforced Protocol Guardrails (Priority: P2)

As a security-conscious maintainer I need malformed or unsigned envelopes rejected so downstream components are never exposed to spoofed traffic.

**Why this priority**: Guardrails reduce protocol drift risk and align with the roadmap item on ZeroMQ handshake hardening.

**Independent Test**: Replay a captured message with a bad HMAC via the demo harness and confirm the kernel logs a signature failure without forwarding to the router.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an incoming message with an invalid HMAC, **When** the bridge validates headers, **Then** it drops the payload, emits a structured warning, and leaves sockets open for valid traffic.

---

### User Story 3 - Operability Insights (Priority: P3)

As an on-call maintainer I need baseline diagnostics so I can triage Phase 1 issues without attaching a debugger.

**Why this priority**: Early observability keeps the roadmap on track and prepares for CI smoke runs.

**Independent Test**: Run the kernel with debug logging enabled and verify correlation IDs, socket bindings, and heartbeat metrics appear in structured logs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the kernel boots, **When** logging is enabled, **Then** startup logs include connection file path, socket endpoints, and capability flags.

---

### Edge Cases

- Connection file references sockets that fail to bind; kernel must exit gracefully with actionable error output.
- Heartbeat channel stops receiving probes; supervisor should log degraded state without crashing other channels.
- Execute payload exceeds 1 MB; bridge should stream without truncation and note payload size in metrics.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The kernel MUST parse Jupyter connection files and bind shell, control, stdin, iopub, and heartbeat sockets before accepting traffic.
- **FR-002**: The bridge MUST validate message signatures and ordering per Jupyter messaging spec, dropping and logging any failures.
- **FR-003**: The router MUST handle `execute_request` by forwarding to a stub runtime that echoes input code and emits matching `execute_result`/stream frames.
- **FR-004**: The kernel MUST surface structured logs with correlation IDs for every inbound and outbound message.
- **FR-005**: The control channel MUST honour interrupt and shutdown requests without terminating healthy workers.
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST provide a quickstart showing how to launch the Phase 1 kernel against nbclient for manual verification.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **KernelProcessConfig**: Captures CLI/config-derived settings (connection file path, log level, runtime mode) consumed during bootstrap.
- **ProtocolEnvelope**: Typed representation of Jupyter message frames (identities, header, parent, metadata, content) used for validation and logging.
- **ExecutionOutcome**: Stub runtime result containing echoed source, synthetic stream output, and status metadata returned to the bridge.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Demo script completes an execute echo round-trip in under 2 seconds on a developer laptop.
- **SC-002**: 100% of malformed or unsigned messages are rejected and logged without disturbing subsequent valid traffic during a 10-minute soak.
- **SC-003**: Heartbeat channel remains responsive (no missed acks) for 30 minutes under echo workload.
- **SC-004**: Onboarding instructions enable a new contributor to run the Phase 1 demo in under 15 minutes from a clean environment.

## Assumptions

- Phase 1 runtime remains a deterministic echo stub; evaluation of arbitrary Haskell code is deferred to Phase 2.
- Contributors install the recommended GHC 9.6.4 toolchain via ghcup as outlined in `AGENTS.md` before running demos.
- CI smoke coverage for Phase 1 will rely on nbclient-driven notebooks rather than full JupyterLab UI sessions.

# Quick Start Guide: Installation & CLI Infrastructure

**Feature**: 004-install-cli  
**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Audience**: Developers implementing Phase 4 installation commands

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the development environment ready:

```bash
# Verify GHC version
ghc --version  # Should be 9.12.2+

# Verify existing HsJupyter kernel builds
cd /home/jjunho/projetos/HsJupyter
cabal build hs-jupyter-kernel

# Verify Jupyter is available for testing
jupyter --version
```

### Project Structure Overview

The CLI extension follows existing constitutional patterns:

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DoctorSpec.hs            # Diagnostic functionality tests
```

## Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: CLI Command Structure

Start with the command parser using `optparse-applicative`:

```haskell
-- src/HsJupyter/CLI/Commands.hs
data CLICommand 
  = Install InstallOptions
  | Doctor DoctorOptions  
  | Uninstall UninstallOptions
  | List ListOptions
  | Version VersionOptions

data InstallOptions = InstallOptions
  { installUser :: Bool
  , installForce :: Bool
  , installQuiet :: Bool
  -- ... other options from spec
  }
```

### Step 2: Constitutional Integration

Integrate with existing error handling and observability:

```haskell
-- Use existing RuntimeDiagnostic system
import HsJupyter.Runtime.ErrorHandling (withErrorContext, enrichDiagnostic)

-- Use existing katip logging
import HsJupyter.Runtime.Telemetry (logStructured, withTelemetryContext)

installKernel :: InstallOptions -> IO (Either CLIDiagnostic KernelInstallation)
installKernel opts = withErrorContext "kernel-installation" $ do
  logStructured InfoS "Starting kernel installation" (toObject opts)
  -- Implementation follows constitutional patterns
```

### Step 3: Test-First Development

Write tests before implementation:

```haskell
-- test/unit/InstallSpec.hs
spec :: Spec
spec = describe "Kernel Installation" $ do
  describe "User Story 1: Jupyter Kernel Installation" $ do
    it "installs kernel successfully with default options" $ do
      -- Test acceptance scenario 1
      
    it "updates existing installation with --force" $ do
      -- Test acceptance scenario 2
      
    it "installs to user directory with --user" $ do
      -- Test acceptance scenario 3
```

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (P1 User Story)

Focus on core installation functionality:

1. **CLI parsing**: Implement basic `install` command with essential options
2. **Jupyter detection**: Find kernelspec directories using `directory` library
3. **Kernel registration**: Create and write kernel.json files
4. **Basic validation**: Verify installation can launch kernel

**Success criteria**: `hs-jupyter-kernel install` works on clean system

### Phase 2: Diagnostics (P2 User Story)

Add troubleshooting capabilities:

1. **System scanning**: Detect Jupyter environments and existing installations
2. **Issue identification**: Check for common problems (permissions, paths, versions)
3. **Recommendations**: Provide actionable solutions based on findings
4. **Structured output**: Support `--json` for programmatic use

**Success criteria**: `hs-jupyter-kernel doctor` identifies and suggests fixes for issues

### Phase 3: Advanced Configuration (P3 User Stories)

Add customization and enterprise features:

1. **Custom paths**: Support `--jupyter-dir`, `--kernelspec-dir`, `--ghc-path`
2. **Configuration options**: Custom kernel.json settings, resource limits
3. **Multiple installations**: Handle various Jupyter environments
4. **Programmatic access**: JSON output, quiet mode, exit codes

**Success criteria**: Advanced installation scenarios work reliably

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

Test individual functions and modules:

```bash
# Run CLI module tests
cabal test unit --test-option="--match=/CLI/"

# Run specific command tests  
cabal test unit --test-option="--match=/Install/"
```

### Integration Tests

Test complete workflows:

```bash
# Test end-to-end installation
cabal test integration --test-option="--match=/InstallWorkflow/"

# Test diagnostic workflows
cabal test integration --test-option="--match=/DiagnosticsWorkflow/"
```

### Manual Testing

Use local development workflow:

```bash
# Build with CLI extensions
cabal build hs-jupyter-kernel

# Test installation (be careful with existing setups!)
dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-9.12.2/hs-jupyter-kernel-0.1.0.0/x/hs-jupyter-kernel/build/hs-jupyter-kernel/hs-jupyter-kernel install --user --dry-run

# Test diagnostics
./hs-jupyter-kernel doctor --json
```

## Key Implementation Notes

### Constitutional Compliance

- **Error Handling**: Use `HsJupyter.Runtime.ErrorHandling` patterns
- **Logging**: Structured logging via katip with correlation IDs
- **Resource Management**: Respect timeout and memory limits
- **Cancellation**: Support TMVar-based cancellation for long operations

### Cross-Platform Considerations

- Use `System.FilePath` for path operations
- Handle Windows/Unix permission differences
- Test on multiple Jupyter installation types (pip, conda, system)

### Performance Targets

- Installation: <2 minutes on standard systems
- Diagnostics: <5 seconds response time
- Memory usage: <100MB during operations
- Disk usage: <100MB temporary files

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Path handling**: Use proper cross-platform path functions
2. **Permissions**: Handle user vs system installation scope correctly
3. **Jupyter variants**: Support both JupyterLab and classic Notebook
4. **Error messages**: Provide actionable, user-friendly error descriptions
5. **State management**: Ensure atomic operations for installation/uninstallation

## Integration Points

### With Existing Kernel

The CLI commands extend the existing kernel executable:

```haskell
-- app/KernelMain.hs (modify existing)
main :: IO ()
main = do
  args <- getArgs
  case args of
    ("install":rest) -> runInstallCommand rest
    ("doctor":rest) -> runDoctorCommand rest
    -- ... other CLI commands
    [] -> runKernelServer -- existing behavior
    _ -> runKernelServer  -- existing behavior
```

### With Constitutional Framework

All CLI functionality integrates with:

- **ResourceGuard**: For operation timeouts and limits
- **RuntimeDiagnostic**: For structured error reporting  
- **Telemetry**: For observability and debugging
- **ErrorHandling**: For DRY error management patterns

## Next Steps

After implementing this specification:

1. Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate detailed implementation tasks
2. Create feature branch following constitutional naming: `004-install-cli`
3. Implement following test-first constitutional principles
4. Update cabal file with new dependencies (`optparse-applicative`)
5. Document any architectural decisions in `docs/architecture.md`

**Feature**: 004-install-cli  
**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Findings

### CLI Framework Choice

**Decision**: Use `optparse-applicative` for command-line interface parsing

**Rationale**:

- Well-established Haskell library with excellent type safety
- Automatic help generation and subcommand support
- Integrates cleanly with existing constitutional error handling patterns
- Minimal dependencies beyond what HsJupyter already requires

**Alternatives considered**:

- Custom argument parsing: Rejected due to complexity and maintenance burden
- `cmdargs`: Rejected due to less type-safe interface and template Haskell dependencies

### Jupyter Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Direct kernelspec directory manipulation with validation

**Rationale**:

- Jupyter's kernelspec system is well-documented and stable across versions
- Direct filesystem approach avoids Python dependency for basic operations
- Enables custom path support for non-standard Jupyter installations
- Aligns with constitutional simplicity principles (KISS, YAGNI)

**Alternatives considered**:

- `jupyter kernelspec install` subprocess calls: Rejected due to Python dependency requirement
- Python wrapper scripts: Rejected due to additional complexity and deployment burden

### System Integration Approach

**Decision**: Use Haskell `process`, `directory`, and `filepath` libraries for system operations

**Rationale**:

- Cross-platform compatibility for Linux, macOS, Windows
- Direct integration with existing Haskell codebase
- Constitutional compliance with defensive programming (proper error handling)
- Leverages existing ResourceGuard patterns for timeouts and resource limits

**Alternatives considered**:

- Shell script wrappers: Rejected due to platform compatibility issues
- External system utilities: Rejected due to dependency management complexity

### Error Handling Integration

**Decision**: Extend existing `RuntimeDiagnostic` system for CLI-specific errors

**Rationale**:

- Maintains consistency with established constitutional error handling patterns
- Leverages existing structured logging through katip
- Enables proper error propagation and user-friendly messages
- Supports diagnostic command requirements with detailed error reporting

**Alternatives considered**:

- Separate CLI error system: Rejected due to duplication and constitutional DRY violations
- Basic string-based errors: Rejected due to lack of structure and observability

### Configuration Management

**Decision**: JSON-based kernel.json generation with validation

**Rationale**:

- Standard Jupyter kernel specification format
- Leverages existing `aeson` JSON handling infrastructure
- Enables custom configuration while maintaining compatibility
- Supports constitutional validation and defensive programming principles

**Alternatives considered**:

- YAML configuration: Rejected due to additional dependencies and complexity
- INI-style configuration: Rejected due to limited structure and nesting capabilities

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: Lazy evaluation with strict error boundaries

**Rationale**:

- Installation operations benefit from lazy I/O for large directory scans
- Constitutional performance targets (<2min install, <5s diagnostics) achievable
- Existing constitutional patterns for resource limits and timeouts apply
- Minimal memory footprint aligns with <100MB constraint

**Alternatives considered**:

- Strict evaluation throughout: Rejected due to memory usage concerns for large Jupyter environments
- Streaming I/O libraries: Rejected as premature optimization for typical installation scenarios

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Mirror existing test structure with CLI-specific integration tests

**Rationale**:

- Follows constitutional test-first implementation principles
- Leverages existing hspec infrastructure and patterns
- Integration tests can validate end-to-end Jupyter interaction
- Unit tests ensure individual command functionality

**Alternatives considered**:

- Golden tests for CLI output: Considered but deferred to implementation phase based on output complexity
- Mock-based testing: Rejected in favor of real filesystem integration for reliability

## Implementation Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- Existing `HsJupyter.Runtime.ErrorHandling` module for error patterns
- Existing `HsJupyter.Runtime.Telemetry` for observability integration
- Existing `katip` structured logging infrastructure
- Constitutional test patterns from established modules

### External Dependencies

- `optparse-applicative` (CLI parsing)
- `process` (system command execution)
- `directory` (filesystem operations)
- `filepath` (cross-platform path handling)
- Standard base libraries (no additional package dependencies required)

### System Dependencies

- Jupyter installation (Lab or Notebook) for integration testing
- GHC 9.12.2+ for kernel verification during installation
- Standard shell environment (bash/zsh/cmd) for process execution

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk

- CLI command parsing and validation
- JSON kernel.json file generation
- Basic filesystem operations for kernelspec management

### Medium Risk

- Cross-platform path handling for various Jupyter installation types
- Jupyter environment detection across different Python installations (conda, pip, system)
- Permission handling for system vs user installation modes

### High Risk

- None identified with current approach and constitutional compliance

## Performance Validation Approach

### Benchmarking Strategy

- Installation time measurement on clean systems with various Jupyter setups
- Diagnostic command response time validation
- Memory usage profiling during installation operations
- Timeout behavior validation for network-dependent operations

### Success Criteria Validation

- SC-001: <2 minutes installation ‚Üí measure on standard test systems
- SC-002: 95% success rate ‚Üí automated testing across platform variations
- SC-003: 90% issue resolution via doctor ‚Üí diagnostic accuracy measurement

## Entity Relationships

```text
JupyterEnvironment -> contains multiple -> KernelInstallation
InstallationConfiguration -> configures -> KernelInstallation
DiagnosticResult -> analyzes -> JupyterEnvironment + KernelInstallation
Issue -> identified within -> DiagnosticResult
Recommendation -> suggests actions for -> Issue
```

## State Transitions

### Installation Status Transitions

```text
NotInstalled 
  -> install command -> Installed | InstalledWithIssues | Corrupted

InstalledWithIssues 
  -> doctor command -> identifies issues
  -> install --force -> Installed | Corrupted

Corrupted 
  -> uninstall -> NotInstalled
  -> install --force -> Installed | InstalledWithIssues

Installed 
  -> uninstall -> NotInstalled
  -> install --force -> Installed (version update)
```

### Health Status Transitions

```text
Healthy -> validation detects issues -> HealthyWithWarnings | Degraded | Broken
HealthyWithWarnings -> fix applied -> Healthy
Degraded -> repair actions -> Healthy | HealthyWithWarnings | Broken
Broken -> reinstallation -> Healthy | Degraded
```

## Validation Rules

### KernelInstallation Validation

- `kiKernelspecPath` MUST point to valid kernel.json file
- `kiGHCPath` MUST be executable and accessible
- `kiDisplayName` MUST be non-empty and valid for Jupyter display
- `kiVersion` MUST match actual kernel executable version

### InstallationConfiguration Validation

- `icCustomPaths.cpGHCPath` if provided MUST be executable
- `icCustomPaths.cpKernelspecDir` if provided MUST be writable
- `icInstallScope` MUST be compatible with available permissions
- Resource limits in `icKernelConfig` MUST be positive values

### DiagnosticResult Validation

- `drIssuesFound` MUST be sorted by severity (Critical first)
- `drRecommendations` MUST be sorted by priority (Immediate first)
- Each `Issue` MUST have corresponding `Recommendation` when actionable
- `drOverallStatus` MUST reflect worst issue severity found

## Integration Points

### Constitutional Error Handling

All data models integrate with existing `RuntimeDiagnostic` system:

```haskell
-- CLI-specific errors extend existing pattern
data CLIDiagnostic
  = InstallationError Issue
  | ValidationError Text
  | ConfigurationError Text
  | SystemIntegrationError Text
  deriving (Show, Eq)

instance ToDiagnostic CLIDiagnostic where
  toDiagnostic (InstallationError issue) = 
    RuntimeDiagnostic { ... }  -- Maps to constitutional error format
```

### Observability Integration

All entities support structured logging through existing katip infrastructure:

```haskell
instance ToObject KernelInstallation where
  toObject ki = fromList
    [ "kernelspec_path" .= kiKernelspecPath ki
    , "version" .= kiVersion ki
    , "status" .= show (kiStatus ki)
    ]
```

### Resource Management

Integrates with existing `ResourceGuard` for installation operations:

```haskell
-- Installation operations respect constitutional resource limits
installWithGuard :: ResourceGuard -> InstallationConfiguration -> IO (Either CLIDiagnostic KernelInstallation)
```
# Implementation Plan: Installation & CLI Infrastructure

**Branch**: `004-install-cli` | **Date**: 2025-01-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-install-cli/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create command-line installation and management tools for HsJupyter kernel integration with Jupyter environments. Primary requirement: enable users to install, configure, and diagnose HsJupyter kernel installations through simple CLI commands (`install`, `doctor`, `uninstall`). Technical approach: extend existing kernel executable with CLI subcommands that integrate with Jupyter's kernelspec system, leveraging constitutional error handling and observability patterns.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Haskell with GHC 9.12.2+ via ghcup  
**Primary Dependencies**: existing HsJupyter kernel, process, filepath, directory, unix (for system integration), optparse-applicative (CLI parsing)  
**Storage**: filesystem-based (Jupyter kernelspec directories, kernel.json files)  
**Testing**: hspec for unit and integration tests, following existing constitutional patterns  
**Target Platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows (cross-platform Jupyter integration)
**Project Type**: single project (CLI extension to existing kernel)  
**Performance Goals**: <2 minutes for installation, <5 seconds for diagnostics, <30 seconds for operations with dependencies available  
**Constraints**: <100MB temporary disk usage during installation, must integrate with existing constitutional error handling and observability  
**Scale/Scope**: single-user installations, integration with standard Jupyter environments (Lab, Notebook, kernelspec system)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Post-Phase 1 Re-evaluation**: All gates continue to pass with completed design artifacts.

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Documentation-first: spec and plan must precede implementation | ‚úÖ | Comprehensive spec with 4 prioritized user stories and 15 functional requirements complete |
| Test-first mindset: define acceptance & soak tests before runtime work | ‚úÖ | Acceptance scenarios defined for each user story, performance targets specified (<2min install, <5s diagnostics) |
| Specification-driven development: follow speckit workflow | ‚úÖ | Currently in /speckit.plan phase following proper workflow |
| Observability foundation: structured logging and diagnostics | ‚úÖ | Will integrate with existing katip structured logging, leverage Runtime/Telemetry module |
| Modular architecture & strong design: apply SOLID principles, composition over inheritance | ‚úÖ | CLI commands as composable functions, separate concerns for installation/diagnostics/configuration |
| Simplicity & maintainability: apply DRY, KISS, YAGNI principles | ‚úÖ | Minimal CLI extension to existing kernel, only implement explicitly required user stories |
| Resilience & defensive programming: error handling, Law of Demeter | ‚úÖ | Leverage existing RuntimeDiagnostic system, validate inputs, handle Jupyter environment edge cases |
| Pragmatic balance: Rule of Three, cohesion/coupling balance | ‚úÖ | Single CLI extension with focused responsibilities, minimal coupling to Jupyter internals |

**Structure Decision**: Single project extension leveraging existing HsJupyter architecture. CLI functionality added as new module tree under `src/HsJupyter/CLI/` with integration tests following established patterns. Main executable extended to support subcommands while preserving existing kernel functionality.

## Error Handling

All commands implement constitutional error handling patterns:

### Error Response Format (JSON mode)

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "InstallationError|ValidationError|ConfigurationError|SystemIntegrationError",
    "message": "User-friendly error description", 
    "details": "Technical details for troubleshooting",
    "suggestions": ["Possible solutions"],
    "exit_code": 1
  },
  "context": {
    "command": "install",
    "options": ["--user", "--force"],
    "system_info": "Relevant system details"
  }
}
```

### Constitutional Compliance

- All operations respect resource limits (timeout, memory)
- Structured logging via katip for all operations
- Cancellation support through TMVar patterns
- Defensive programming with input validation
- Law of Demeter compliance in module interactions

## Testing Contracts

### Unit Test Requirements

Each command MUST have corresponding test cases that verify:

1. **Success scenarios**: All documented options and workflows
2. **Error scenarios**: All documented exit codes and error conditions  
3. **Edge cases**: Invalid inputs, missing dependencies, permission issues
4. **JSON output**: All documented JSON structures and fields
5. **Constitutional compliance**: Resource limits, cancellation, logging

### Integration Test Requirements

Full workflow tests that verify:

1. **End-to-end installation**: From clean system to functional kernel
2. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Linux, macOS, Windows
3. **Jupyter integration**: Kernel appears and functions in Jupyter
4. **Error recovery**: System recovers gracefully from failures
5. **Performance targets**: Commands meet specified time limits

### Acceptance Test Mapping

Each user story acceptance scenario becomes an automated test:

- **User Story 1**: `test/integration/InstallWorkflowSpec.hs`
- **User Story 2**: `test/integration/DiagnosticsWorkflowSpec.hs`  
- **User Story 3**: `test/integration/CustomConfigurationSpec.hs`
- **User Story 4**: `test/integration/SystemIntegrationSpec.hs`# Feature Specification: Installation & CLI Infrastructure

**Feature Branch**: `004-install-cli`  
**Created**: 2025-01-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Installation & CLI Infrastructure"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

> Align every user story with the constitution: document-first narrative, explicit pre-code tests, and observability hooks. Each story MUST describe how logging/metrics/diagnostics validate the behaviour.

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Jupyter Kernel Installation (Priority: P1)

Data scientists and Haskell developers want to easily install the HsJupyter kernel into their existing Jupyter environment without complex manual configuration steps.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary entry point for all users. Without simple installation, the kernel cannot be used regardless of its functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `hs-jupyter-kernel install` on a clean system with Jupyter installed and verifying the kernel appears in `jupyter kernelspec list` and launches successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a system with Jupyter installed but no HsJupyter kernel, **When** user runs `hs-jupyter-kernel install`, **Then** the kernel is registered and available in Jupyter Lab/Notebook
2. **Given** an existing HsJupyter kernel installation, **When** user runs `hs-jupyter-kernel install --force`, **Then** the kernel is updated to the new version
3. **Given** insufficient permissions for system-wide installation, **When** user runs `hs-jupyter-kernel install --user`, **Then** the kernel is installed in user-specific location

---

### User Story 2 - Installation Diagnostics and Troubleshooting (Priority: P2)

Users experiencing installation issues need clear diagnostic information and guided troubleshooting to resolve common problems without manual debugging.

**Why this priority**: Reduces support burden and improves user experience by enabling self-service troubleshooting.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running `hs-jupyter-kernel doctor` on systems with various configuration issues and verifying helpful diagnostic output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a system with installation issues, **When** user runs `hs-jupyter-kernel doctor`, **Then** specific problems are identified with actionable resolution steps
2. **Given** a correctly installed kernel, **When** user runs `hs-jupyter-kernel doctor`, **Then** system reports healthy status with version information
3. **Given** missing dependencies, **When** user runs `hs-jupyter-kernel doctor`, **Then** missing components are identified with installation instructions

---

### User Story 3 - Custom Installation Configuration (Priority: P3)

Advanced users need to customize installation paths, kernel configurations, and integration settings for specific deployment environments.

**Why this priority**: Enables enterprise deployments and custom environments while not blocking basic usage.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by installing with custom configuration options and verifying the kernel operates with the specified settings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a custom Jupyter environment, **When** user specifies custom paths via `--jupyter-dir` and `--kernel-dir`, **Then** kernel is installed in specified locations
2. **Given** need for specific kernel configuration, **When** user provides custom kernel.json settings, **Then** kernel operates with specified resource limits and display name
3. **Given** multiple Haskell versions, **When** user specifies `--ghc-path`, **Then** kernel uses the specified GHC installation

---

### User Story 4 - System Integration and Verification (Priority: P3)

System administrators and CI/CD pipelines need programmatic installation verification and integration with package managers.

**Why this priority**: Enables automated deployments and enterprise integration scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running installation commands in automated environments and verifying JSON/structured output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a CI/CD pipeline, **When** installation commands are run with `--json` flag, **Then** structured output enables programmatic verification
2. **Given** need for silent installation, **When** user runs commands with `--quiet` flag, **Then** installation proceeds without interactive prompts
3. **Given** multiple kernel versions, **When** user runs `hs-jupyter-kernel list`, **Then** all installed versions are displayed with status information

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Jupyter is not installed or not in PATH?
- How does system handle corrupted existing kernel installations?
- What occurs when insufficient disk space or permissions prevent installation?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during installation verification?
- What happens when GHC/Haskell dependencies are missing or incompatible versions?
- How does the system behave when multiple Jupyter environments exist (conda, pip, system)?

- [X] T011 [US1] Wire `KernelProcess.hs` and `RequestRouter.hs` to use `Runtime.Manager` for execute requests, returning updated outcomes.

**Checkpoint**: Sequential cells run with persistent state; integration test verifies behaviour.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 ‚Äì Responsive Cancellation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Interrupt long-running cells, returning `status=abort` promptly.

### Tests for User Story 2

- [X] T012 [P] [US2] Extend `RuntimeNotebookSpec.hs` with cancellation scenario exercising `interrupt_request`.
- [X] T013 [US2] Add unit test in `test/unit/RuntimeManagerSpec.hs` covering cancellation token propagation.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T014 [US2] Add cancel tokens and async management to `Runtime.Manager` (register jobs, cancel evaluation threads).
- [X] T015 [US2] Ensure `KernelProcess` control loop forwards interrupts to runtime manager and releases queued jobs cleanly.

**Checkpoint**: Cancellation test passes; runtime responds with `status=abort` within SLA.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 ‚Äì Diagnostics & Resource Guards (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Structured diagnostics and resource enforcement for failures.

### Tests for User Story 3

- [X] T016 [P] [US3] Add unit tests in `test/unit/DiagnosticsSpec.hs` for compilation/runtime error translation.
- [X] T017 [P] [US3] Add unit tests in `test/unit/ResourceGuardSpec.hs` for CPU/memory limits and stream truncation.

- [X] T020 [US3] Integrate diagnostics emission in `Runtime.Manager`/`Evaluation` (structured error handling, telemetry).
- [X] T021 [US3] Emit telemetry metrics/logs using `Runtime/Telemetry.hs` and ensure `KernelProcess` forwards metrics to bridge/logging stack.

**Checkpoint**: Error and resource guard tests pass; telemetry logs are produced for failures. ‚úÖ **PHASE 5 COMPLETE**

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final documentation, demos, and refactor touches.

- [ ] T022 Update `specs/002-runtime-core/quickstart.md` with runtime demo steps and golden notebook instructions.
- [ ] T023 Add developer docs in `docs/developer/README.md` covering runtime queue usage, cancellation flags, resource tuning.
- [X] T024 Run full `cabal v2-test` and record results/known issues in quickstart troubleshooting.
- [X] T025 [P] Refine logging format (correlation IDs, resource guard events) in `KernelProcess.hs` and `Runtime/Telemetry.hs`.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- Setup (Phase 1) precedes foundational work.
- Foundational (Phase 2) must complete before user story tasks begin.
- User stories follow priority order: US1 (stateful execution) ‚Üí US2 (cancellation) ‚Üí US3 (diagnostics/guards). Later stories depend on runtime manager from US1.
- Tests precede implementation tasks within each story.
- Polish phase executes after all stories meet acceptance.

## Parallel Opportunities

- T003‚ÄìT005 (session state, diagnostics, telemetry) can progress in parallel once interfaces agreed.
- Within US1, tests T007/T008 can run concurrently; implementations T009‚ÄìT011 should follow queue/evaluation wiring order.
- US3 unit tests T016/T017 can be authored while resource guard implementation is in progress.
- Polish tasks T022‚ÄìT025 can be split between contributors after core functionality stabilises.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Complete foundational runtime scaffolding (types, diagnostics, telemetry).
2. Deliver US1 sequential execution (MVP) with green tests.
3. Layer cancellation (US2) to satisfy interrupt SLA.
4. Add diagnostics and resource guards (US3) plus telemetry refinements.
5. Finish documentation/polish and rerun full test suite.

# Runtime Core Quickstart Guide

**Phase 2 Runtime Core Implementation** - Get up and running with the HsJupyter runtime core functionality.

## Prerequisites

- GHC 9.12.2+ installed via `ghcup`
- Cabal 3.0+ 
- Python 3.8+ with `pyzmq` for testing

## Building the Runtime Core

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/jjunho/HsJupyter.git
cd HsJupyter
git checkout 002-runtime-core

# Build all components
cabal v2-build all

# Run tests to verify installation
cabal v2-test unit
cabal v2-test integration
```

## Testing the Runtime

### Unit Tests (38+ test cases)

```bash
# Run all unit tests
cabal v2-test unit --test-show-details=streaming

# Individual test suites
cabal v2-test unit -t DiagnosticsSpec
cabal v2-test unit -t ResourceGuardSpec  
cabal v2-test unit -t SessionStateSpec
cabal v2-test unit -t RuntimeManagerSpec
```

### Integration Tests (12+ test cases)

```bash
# Golden notebook workflow tests
cabal v2-test integration --test-show-details=streaming

# Specific test scenarios
cabal v2-test integration -t "sequential execution"
cabal v2-test integration -t "cancellation"
cabal v2-test integration -t "resource limits"
```

## Runtime Demo Steps

### 1. Start the Kernel

```bash
# Start kernel with default configuration
cabal v2-run hs-jupyter-kernel -- \
  --connection-file=scripts/demo/sample-connection.json \
  --verbose
```

### 2. Golden Notebook Test

Use the Python test harness to verify sequential execution:

```bash
cd scripts/demo
python3 phase1_echo_notebook.py
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Cell A: `let x = 42` ‚Üí Execution count 1, defines binding
- Cell B: `x + 10` ‚Üí Execution count 2, returns `52` (reuses binding from A)
- Cell C: `let y = x * 2` ‚Üí Execution count 3, creates new binding using x

### 3. Cancellation Demo

```python
# In phase1_echo_notebook.py, test cancellation
import time
import threading

def test_cancellation():
    # Submit long-running cell
    cell_id = submit_execute_request("Thread.sleep(5000)")
    
    # Cancel after 1 second  
    time.sleep(1)
    send_interrupt_request()
    
    # Should receive status=abort
    reply = wait_for_execute_reply()
    assert reply['content']['status'] == 'abort'
```

### 4. Resource Limit Testing

```python
def test_resource_limits():
    # Submit memory-intensive code
    cell_id = submit_execute_request("replicate 1000000 'x'")
    
    # Should truncate output at configured limit
    reply = wait_for_execute_reply()
    output = reply['content']['text']
    assert len(output) <= 1048576  # 1MB limit
```

## Runtime Core Components

### Session State Management

The runtime maintains persistent state across cell executions:

```haskell
-- Runtime/SessionState.hs
data RuntimeSessionState = RuntimeSessionState
  { rsExecutionCount :: Int
  , rsBindings :: Map Text Text  
  , rsModuleArtifacts :: Map Text ModuleArtifact
  , rsImports :: [Text]
  }
```

### Job Queue Architecture

STM-based thread-safe execution queue:

```haskell
-- Runtime/Manager.hs  
withRuntimeManager :: ResourceBudget -> Int -> (RuntimeManager -> IO a) -> IO a
submitExecute :: RuntimeManager -> ExecuteContext -> JobMetadata -> Text -> IO ExecutionOutcome
```

### Resource Guards

Configurable CPU/memory/output limits:

```haskell
-- Runtime/ResourceGuard.hs
data ResourceLimits = ResourceLimits
  { rcMaxCpuSeconds :: Double      -- 30s default
  , rcMaxMemoryMB :: Int          -- 512MB default  
  , rcMaxOutputBytes :: Int       -- 1MB default
  }
```

## Configuration

### Resource Tuning

Edit runtime limits in your application:

```haskell
let customLimits = ResourceLimits
      { rcMaxCpuSeconds = 60.0     -- 1 minute timeout
      , rcMaxMemoryMB = 1024       -- 1GB memory limit
      , rcMaxOutputBytes = 2097152 -- 2MB output limit
      }
```

### Queue Capacity

Adjust concurrent execution capacity:

```haskell
-- Start runtime manager with capacity for 5 concurrent jobs
withRuntimeManager resourceBudget 5 $ \manager -> do
  -- Your runtime operations
```

### Diagnostics Level

Configure diagnostic verbosity:

```haskell
-- Runtime/Diagnostics.hs
data DiagnosticSeverity = SeverityInfo | SeverityWarning | SeverityError
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

**Missing dependencies:**
```bash
cabal v2-configure --enable-tests
cabal v2-install --dependencies-only
```

**GHC version mismatch:**
```bash
ghcup install ghc 9.12.2
ghcup set ghc 9.12.2
```

### Runtime Issues

**Memory limit exceeded:**
- Increase `rcMaxMemoryMB` in ResourceLimits
- Check for memory leaks in evaluation code

**Timeout errors:**
- Increase `rcMaxCpuSeconds` for long-running computations
- Verify cancellation tokens are being checked

**State not persisting:**
- Check session state management in RuntimeManager
- Verify bindings are being stored correctly

### Test Failures

**Unit test compilation errors:**
```bash
# Check test dependencies
cabal v2-build test:unit --dry-run

# Verify all modules compile
cabal v2-build lib:hs-jupyter-kernel
```

**Integration test timeouts:**
```bash
# Run with verbose output
cabal v2-test integration --test-show-details=streaming

# Check ZeroMQ connectivity
python3 scripts/demo/phase1_echo_notebook.py --debug
```

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Runtime Features

1. **Add unit tests first:**
   ```bash
   # Create new test file
   touch test/unit/NewFeatureSpec.hs
   
   # Add to cabal file other-modules
   vim hs-jupyter-kernel.cabal
   ```

2. **Implement feature:**
   ```bash
   # Create implementation
   touch src/HsJupyter/Runtime/NewFeature.hs
   
   # Add to cabal exposed-modules
   vim hs-jupyter-kernel.cabal
   ```

3. **Integration testing:**
   ```bash
   # Add integration scenarios
   vim test/integration/RuntimeNotebookSpec.hs
   ```

4. **Verify full pipeline:**
   ```bash
   cabal v2-test all
   python3 scripts/demo/phase1_echo_notebook.py
   ```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Measure execution latency
time cabal v2-test integration -t "sequential execution"

# Memory usage profiling  
cabal v2-run hs-jupyter-kernel +RTS -s

# Resource limit stress testing
python3 scripts/demo/stress_test.py
```

## Next Steps

- **Real GHC Integration**: Replace echo-based evaluation with hint library
- **Advanced Cancellation**: Add interrupt points within evaluation
- **Metrics Collection**: Implement telemetry dashboard
- **Distributed Runtime**: Multi-node execution support

## Status: ‚úÖ Phase 2 Runtime Core Complete

All core functionality implemented and tested:
- ‚úÖ Stateful execution pipeline  
- ‚úÖ Responsive cancellation
- ‚úÖ Resource guards and diagnostics
- ‚úÖ 75+ comprehensive tests
- ‚úÖ ZeroMQ protocol integration maintained

# Research Summary: Phase 2 ‚Äì Runtime Core

## Decision 1: GHC API vs hint
- **Decision**: Use the GHC API directly (via `ghc-lib` interfaces) for session management while wrapping evaluation helpers similar to `hint`.
- **Rationale**: Offers fine-grained control over session state, module loading, and diagnostics without the performance penalty/black-box behaviour of `hint`.
- **Alternatives considered**: Pure `hint` (simpler API but less control over concurrency/cancellation), external GHC process per cell (strong isolation but slower and complicates state reuse).

## Decision 2: Execution Job Architecture
- **Decision**: Introduce a single-threaded job queue (`TBQueue ExecutionJob`) managed by `Runtime.Manager`, ensuring ordered execution with cancellation hooks.
- **Rationale**: Matches Jupyter semantics (one execution at a time), simplifies state management, and provides a clear interception point for cancellation/resource guards.
- **Alternatives considered**: Fully parallel execution (increases complexity, potential state races), ad-hoc IORef-based state (less robust under cancellation).

## Decision 3: Resource Guard Strategy
- **Decision**: Combine RTS options (time/memory limits) with per-job timers and a lightweight watchdog thread to enforce CPU timeouts.
- **Rationale**: Keeps enforcement in-process without introducing separate sandboxes yet still provides deterministic limits aligned with Phase 1 goals.
- **Alternatives considered**: OS-level sandbox (higher security but significant engineering), post-exec log parsing (non-real-time feedback).

## Decision 4: Diagnostics Format
- **Decision**: Use a structured diagnostic record (`RuntimeDiagnostics`) capturing severity, module, span, summary, and suggestions, encoded to JSON for the bridge.
- **Rationale**: Aligns with Phase 1 success criteria and enables frontend display/telemetry.
- **Alternatives considered**: Plain text messages (simpler but harder to parse), streaming GHC raw output (noisy, inconsistent).

## Decision 5: Testing Approach
- **Decision**: Golden notebook executed via `nbclient`/pyzmq harness for integration, supplemented by `HSPEC` unit tests for session state, cancellation, resource guard, and diagnostics.
- **Rationale**: Reuses Phase 1 demo tooling, ensures coverage of sequential execution, and isolates core components for unit testing.
- **Alternatives considered**: Custom Python harness only (less coverage), manual testing (violates test-first gate).

# Data Model: Phase 2 ‚Äì Runtime Core

## RuntimeSessionState
- **Fields**:
  - `loadedModules :: Map ModuleName ModuleArtifact` ‚Äî cache of compiled modules and artifacts.
  - `imports :: [ImportDecl]` ‚Äî imports carried between cells.
  - `context :: [Binding]` ‚Äî top-level definitions (names, types, values) available for subsequent executions.
  - `executionCount :: Int` ‚Äî monotonically increasing count per session.
  - `resourceBudget :: ResourceBudget` ‚Äî active guard thresholds for CPU/memory/time.
- **Relationships**: Owned by `Runtime.Manager`; mutated by evaluation helpers; serialized for telemetry snapshots.
- **Validation Rules**: Must remain consistent after each job (no duplicate module names, executionCount >= previous).

## ExecutionJob
- **Fields**:
  - `jobId :: Text` ‚Äî unique id (msg_id) for correlation.
  - `source :: Text` ‚Äî cell content.
  - `metadata :: JobMetadata` ‚Äî e.g., silent flag, store_history, user expressions.
  - `submittedAt :: UTCTime` ‚Äî enqueued timestamp.
  - `cancelToken :: TMVar ()` ‚Äî signal used to cancel evaluation when interrupt arrives.
  - `clientInfo :: ExecuteContext` ‚Äî session identifiers (username, session-id, parent header).
- **Relationships**: Enqueued in `TBQueue ExecutionJob`, consumed by runtime worker.
- **Validation Rules**: `source` length must be below payload guard; `cancelToken` initialised empty.

## ExecutionOutcome
- **Fields**:
  - `status :: ExecuteStatus` ‚Äî `Ok`, `Error`, `Abort`, `ResourceLimit`.
  - `streams :: [StreamChunk]` ‚Äî stdout/stderr frames with order preserved.
  - `payload :: [Value]` ‚Äî rich data for display_data/execute_result.
  - `diagnostics :: [RuntimeDiagnostic]` ‚Äî structured errors/warnings.
  - `executionCount :: Int` ‚Äî new count returned to clients.
  - `duration :: NominalDiffTime` ‚Äî wall-clock runtime for telemetry.
- **Relationships**: Produced by runtime worker, converted to protocol envelopes by bridge/router.
- **Validation Rules**: `executionCount` increments by 1 per successful/abort outcome; `ResourceLimit` outcomes must include at least one diagnostic entry.

## ResourceBudget
- **Fields**:
  - `cpuTimeout :: NominalDiffTime` ‚Äî maximum execution duration.
  - `memoryLimit :: Bytes` ‚Äî soft memory cap.
  - `tempDir :: FilePath` ‚Äî sandbox directory for compiled artifacts.
  - `maxStreamBytes :: Int64` ‚Äî per-message stream guard.
- **Relationships**: Configured at session start; consumed by guard/watcher modules.
- **Validation Rules**: All values must be positive; `tempDir` must exist/be writable before execution starts.

## Diagnostics & Supporting Types
- **RuntimeDiagnostic**: severity (error/warning/info), summary, optional file/span, suggestions.
- **ModuleArtifact**: path to compiled object, interface, digest for caching.
- **JobMetadata**: silent/store_history/user_expressions flags supplied by frontend.
- **ExecutionQueue**: `TBQueue ExecutionJob` with bounded size (configurable) to back pressure clients.

## State Transitions
- `RuntimeSessionState` transitions `Cold -> Warm -> Running -> Cancelling -> Draining -> Idle` per execution.
- `ExecutionJob` lifecycle `Enqueued -> Running -> Completed | Cancelled | Failed`.
- Resource guard states `Healthy -> Warning -> LimitExceeded` driving diagnostics.

## Data Volume & Scale Assumptions
- Single active job; queue length small (<=10) during backlog.
- Module artifacts stored under `~/.cache/hsjupyter/<hash>` with per-session temp directories.
- Streams limited to <=1 MB per cell by guard.
# Implementation Plan: Phase 2 ‚Äì Runtime Core

**Branch**: `002-runtime-core` | **Date**: 2025-10-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-runtime-core/spec.md`

## Summary

Design a resilient runtime subsystem that maintains a persistent GHC session per notebook, queues cell executions with cancellation support, and surfaces diagnostics/metrics consistent with Phase 1 observability gates.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Haskell (GHC 9.6.x via ghcup)  
**Primary Dependencies**: GHC API / `hint` for evaluation, `async`, `stm`, `exceptions`, `temporary`, `aeson`  
**Storage**: In-memory session state; no external persistence in this phase  
**Testing**: `hspec` unit tests plus pyzmq/nbclient-driven integration notebooks  
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS developer environments and CI containers  
**Project Type**: Backend service (HsJupyter kernel executable + supporting library modules)  
**Performance Goals**: <2s execution for golden notebook cells; cancellation latency ‚â§1s; heartbeat remains healthy during 30-minute soak  
**Constraints**: Enforce per-session CPU/memory timeouts; clean temporary artifacts; no network access during cell evaluation  
**Scale/Scope**: Single notebook session per kernel process; sequential job processing (parallelism deferred)

## Constitution Check

- Documentation-first: Spec + plan authored before implementation ‚úÖ  
- Test-first: Golden notebooks, cancellation, and diagnostics tests enumerated ‚úÖ  
- Observability: Metrics/logging requirements captured in spec ‚úÖ

**Structure Decision**: Extend existing HsJupyter library with a `Runtime` namespace and targeted test suites; no additional projects required.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations identified; additional complexity log not required.

## Phase 0 ‚Äì Research Focus

- Evaluate GHC API vs `hint` trade-offs for incremental evaluation and sandboxing.  
- Prototype resource guard strategies (RTS options, process isolation, memory limits).  
- Catalogue failure modes (compilation errors, runtime exceptions, async exceptions) and map to diagnostic schema.

## Phase 1 ‚Äì Design Deliverables

- `research.md`: captured decisions on tooling, cancellation mechanics, and resource enforcement.  
- `data-model.md`: detailed `RuntimeSessionState`, `ExecutionJob`, `ExecutionOutcome`, and `ResourceBudget`.  
- `contracts/`: message/result schema between Runtime Manager and Router for ok/error/abort states.  
- `quickstart.md`: instructions for running golden notebooks and cancellation demos.  
- Update agent context with runtime dependencies and testing strategy.

## Phase 2 ‚Äì Task Generation Ready

Once design artifacts are complete, run `/speckit.tasks` to produce an execution plan covering:
- Runtime session management, evaluation, cancellation, and diagnostics modules.  
- Resource guard integration.  
- Unit and integration tests (golden notebook, cancellation, error reporting).  
- Documentation updates for quickstart and observability guidance.

## Constitution Re-Check

Design maintains documentation-first, test-first, and observability gates; proceed to `/speckit.tasks` after Phase 1 outputs exist.
# Feature Specification: Phase 2 ‚Äì Runtime Core

**Feature Branch**: `002-runtime-core`  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Phase 2 ‚Äì Runtime Core"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Stateful Execution Pipeline (Priority: P1)

As a notebook author I can execute Haskell cells sequentially and reuse prior definitions so that the kernel behaves like a real REPL-backed session.

**Why this priority**: Without persistent state the kernel cannot deliver meaningful notebook workflows, blocking downstream milestones.

**Independent Test**: Run a golden notebook where cell B references definitions from cell A; verify `execute_reply` returns the expected value and execution counts increment monotonically in the same session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a fresh runtime session, **When** cell `let x = 2` executes, **Then** the runtime stores `x` and reports `execute_reply` status `ok` with execution count `1`.
2. **Given** the prior cell succeeded, **When** the author executes `x * 5`, **Then** the runtime reuses cached state, emits a stream/result of `10`, and marks execution count `2`.

---

### User Story 2 - Responsive Cancellation (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer I can interrupt a long-running cell and observe a deterministic `abort` outcome so runaway evaluations do not block subsequent work.

**Why this priority**: Controlled cancellation is critical for CI smoke tests and protects shared infrastructure from unresponsive code.

**Independent Test**: Launch a cell containing `threadDelay` or an infinite loop, issue `interrupt_request`, and confirm the runtime stops evaluation and surfaces `status=abort` within one second.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a cell executing, **When** the control channel sends `interrupt_request`, **Then** the runtime cancels worker threads, cleans up temporary artifacts, and replies with `status=abort`.

---

### User Story 3 - Failure Diagnostics & Resource Guards (Priority: P3)

As an on-call maintainer I need structured diagnostics and resource caps so I can triage compilation/runtime failures without attaching a debugger.

**Why this priority**: Rich error data and limits reduce MTTR and align with observability goals set in Phase 1.

**Independent Test**: Execute a cell that triggers a compilation error and another that allocates above the configured memory limit; verify structured diagnostics and throttling metrics appear in logs and telemetry.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a cell that fails to compile, **When** the runtime returns, **Then** the kernel emits diagnostics including module name, line numbers, and a user-friendly summary.
2. **Given** a cell exceeding the configured memory budget, **When** the guard trips, **Then** the runtime aborts execution, reports a `resource-limit` error, and keeps the session healthy.

---

### Edge Cases

- Connection loss or session reset while a cell executes; runtime must teardown safely and surface a restart-required error.
- Concurrent execute requests arriving before previous jobs finish; router must queue or reject additional work deterministically.
- Notebook sends code that mutates `GHC` flags or produces partial results; runtime should isolate options per session and flush buffered output before returning.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The runtime MUST maintain a persistent GHC session per notebook, incrementally loading cells and preserving state across executions.
- **FR-002**: The execution engine MUST stream stdout/stderr and rich payloads back to `JupyterBridge` while retaining execution ordering.
- **FR-003**: Runtime jobs MUST respect cancellation signals and propagate `abort` outcomes within 1 second of receiving an interrupt.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST surface structured diagnostics (module, span, severity, suggestion) for compilation and runtime exceptions.
- **FR-005**: The runtime MUST enforce configurable CPU/memory timeouts and clean up temporary artifacts after each cell.
- **FR-006**: Telemetry MUST record execution duration, queue depth, and resource-limit breaches for Phase 1 observability dashboards.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **RuntimeSessionState**: Tracks loaded modules, imports, and evaluation context for a notebook session.
- **ExecutionJob**: Represents a queued cell with source code, metadata, cancellation token, and execution count.
- **ExecutionOutcome**: Structured result containing status (`ok`, `error`, `abort`), streams, diagnostics, and updated counters.
- **ResourceBudget**: Configuration for CPU time, memory ceiling, and evaluation timeout per session/job.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of cells in the golden notebook execute successfully within 2 seconds while preserving state across cells.
- **SC-002**: Cancellation test completes with `status=abort` response in under 1 second from the interrupt being issued.
- **SC-003**: Compilation/runtime failures include diagnostics covering module, line, and severity for 100% of error cases exercised by the test suite.
- **SC-004**: Resource guard trials terminate and log `resource-limit` diagnostics without crashing the kernel for at least three consecutive soak runs.

## Assumptions

- Phase 2 will continue using the Phase 1 ZeroMQ bridge without introducing additional transport changes.
- The runtime relies on `ghcup`-managed GHC 9.6.x and can shell out to `cabal` only during session bootstrap, not per execution.
- External package installation and multi-session persistence remain out of scope until Phase 3 capability work.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 session management but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of US1/US2, uses same session infrastructure
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent diagnostic system, works with all evaluation types
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Cross-cutting performance layer, integrates with all stories

### Within Each User Story

- Implementation tasks can run in parallel where marked [P] (different files, no dependencies)
- Core functionality before integration tasks
- Unit tests can run in parallel with implementation
- Integration tests after core implementation complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel
- Within each story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch parallel implementation tasks for User Story 1:
Task: "Implement evaluateExpression function in src/HsJupyter/Runtime/GHCRuntime.hs"
Task: "Add expression timeout wrapper (1s timeout) in src/HsJupyter/Runtime/GHCRuntime.hs"
Task: "Add type error detection and mapping in src/HsJupyter/Runtime/GHCDiagnostics.hs"
Task: "Create unit test for basic expression evaluation in test/unit/GHCRuntimeSpec.hs"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic Expression Evaluation)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Variable Persistence)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test core REPL functionality independently
6. Deploy/demo functional Haskell kernel

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Basic evaluation works
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Persistent REPL complete (MVP!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Module system functional
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Production-ready error handling
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Enterprise-ready performance
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous functionality

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Basic Evaluation)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Persistence)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Imports)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently via shared session infrastructure

---

## Implementation Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Preserve all existing Phase 2 functionality - zero breaking changes
- Follow existing STM patterns and HsJupyter.* namespace conventions
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently

## Constitution Guidance

Follow HsJupyter Constitution v1.1.0 Principle VI: Simplicity & Maintainability

- Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Eliminate code duplication through abstractions
- Follow KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Choose simplest solution that solves problem  
- Practice YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Build only what specification requires
# Quickstart: GHC Evaluation

**Feature**: 003-ghc-evaluation | **Date**: 2024-10-25

## Overview

This quickstart guide demonstrates how to implement and test GHC evaluation functionality in HsJupyter. Follow these steps to transform the kernel from an echo server into a functional Haskell REPL.

## Prerequisites

Before starting implementation:

1. **Complete Phase 2**: Ensure all Phase 2 Runtime Core functionality is working
2. **Run existing tests**: Verify all 78 tests pass with `cabal v2-test`
3. **Check dependencies**: Confirm `hint >= 0.9.0` is available in `hs-jupyter-kernel.cabal`
4. **GHC version**: Using GHC 9.12.2 via ghcup

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Core GHC Modules (30 minutes)

Create the foundational GHC integration modules:

```bash
# Create new module files
touch src/HsJupyter/Runtime/GHCRuntime.hs
touch src/HsJupyter/Runtime/GHCSession.hs  
touch src/HsJupyter/Runtime/GHCDiagnostics.hs

# Create corresponding test files
touch test/unit/GHCRuntimeSpec.hs
touch test/unit/GHCSessionSpec.hs
touch test/unit/GHCDiagnosticsSpec.hs
```

**Start with GHCSession.hs** (simplest, no hint dependencies yet):

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
module HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCSession where

import Control.Concurrent.STM
import Data.Set (Set)
import qualified Data.Set as Set
import Data.Text (Text)

data GHCSessionState = GHCSessionState
  { definedBindings :: TVar (Set String)
  , importedModules :: TVar [String]  -- Start simple, ModuleName later
  , sessionActive :: TVar Bool
  }

-- | Create new empty session state
newGHCSession :: STM GHCSessionState
newGHCSession = do
  bindings <- newTVar Set.empty
  modules <- newTVar []
  active <- newTVar True
  return $ GHCSessionState bindings modules active

-- | Add binding to session
addBinding :: GHCSessionState -> String -> STM ()
addBinding session name = modifyTVar' (definedBindings session) (Set.insert name)

-- | List all current bindings
listBindings :: GHCSessionState -> STM [String]
listBindings session = Set.toList <$> readTVar (definedBindings session)
```

**Test it immediately**:

```haskell
-- test/unit/GHCSessionSpec.hs
module GHCSessionSpec (spec) where

import Test.Hspec
import Control.Concurrent.STM
import HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCSession

spec :: Spec
spec = describe "GHCSession" $ do
  it "creates empty session" $ do
    session <- atomically newGHCSession
    bindings <- atomically $ listBindings session
    bindings `shouldBe` []
    
  it "adds and lists bindings" $ do
    session <- atomically newGHCSession
    atomically $ addBinding session "x"
    bindings <- atomically $ listBindings session
    bindings `shouldBe` ["x"]
```

Run test: `cabal v2-test --test-options="--match GHCSession"`

### Step 2: Add Basic hint Integration (45 minutes)

**Update GHCRuntime.hs** with minimal hint integration:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
module HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCRuntime where

import Language.Haskell.Interpreter
import Control.Concurrent.STM
import Data.Text (Text)
import qualified Data.Text as T

data GHCError 
  = CompilationError Text
  | RuntimeError Text
  deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | Simple expression evaluation (no session state yet)
evaluateExpression :: Text -> IO (Either GHCError Text)
evaluateExpression code = do
  result <- runInterpreter $ do
    setImports ["Prelude"]
    interpret (T.unpack code) (as :: String)
  case result of
    Left err -> return . Left . CompilationError . T.pack . show $ err
    Right val -> return . Right . T.pack $ val
```

**Test basic evaluation**:

```haskell
-- test/unit/GHCRuntimeSpec.hs
module GHCRuntimeSpec (spec) where

import Test.Hspec
import HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCRuntime

spec :: Spec
spec = describe "GHCRuntime" $ do
  it "evaluates simple arithmetic" $ do
    result <- evaluateExpression "2 + 3"
    result `shouldBe` Right "5"
    
  it "handles type errors" $ do
    result <- evaluateExpression "1 + \"hello\""
    case result of
      Left (CompilationError _) -> return ()
      _ -> expectationFailure "Expected compilation error"
```

### Step 3: Integrate with Runtime Manager (30 minutes)

**Extend existing RuntimeManager** to support GHC jobs:

```haskell
-- Add to src/HsJupyter/Runtime/Manager.hs
import qualified HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCRuntime as GHC

-- Extend existing RuntimeJob type
data RuntimeJob
  = EchoJob JobId Text (TMVar RuntimeResult)
  | GHCJob JobId Text (TMVar RuntimeResult)  -- NEW

-- Add GHC job processing to existing processJob function
processJob :: RuntimeJob -> RuntimeM ()
processJob job = case job of
  EchoJob jobId input resultVar -> do
    -- existing echo logic
    
  GHCJob jobId code resultVar -> do  -- NEW
    result <- liftIO $ GHC.evaluateExpression code
    case result of
      Right value -> atomically $ putTMVar resultVar $ RuntimeResult
        { resultSuccess = True
        , resultOutput = value
        , resultDiagnostics = []
        }
      Left err -> atomically $ putTMVar resultVar $ RuntimeResult
        { resultSuccess = False  
        , resultOutput = ""
        , resultDiagnostics = [errorToDiagnostic err]
        }
```

### Step 4: Add Integration Test (20 minutes)

**Create end-to-end test**:

```haskell
-- test/integration/GHCNotebookSpec.hs
module GHCNotebookSpec (spec) where

import Test.Hspec
import HsJupyter.Runtime.Manager
import Control.Concurrent.STM

spec :: Spec
spec = describe "GHC Notebook Integration" $ do
  it "processes GHC evaluation jobs" $ do
    manager <- initializeRuntimeManager defaultRuntimeConfig
    resultVar <- newEmptyTMVarIO
    let job = GHCJob (JobId 1) "reverse \"hello\"" resultVar
    
    submitJob manager job
    result <- atomically $ takeTMVar resultVar
    
    resultSuccess result `shouldBe` True
    resultOutput result `shouldBe` "\"olleh\""
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests First

Always write failing tests before implementation:

```bash
# Run specific test while developing
cabal v2-test --test-options="--match GHCRuntime"

# Run all tests to ensure no regression
cabal v2-test
```

### Integration Testing

Test complete workflow from job submission to result:

```bash
# Create integration test for full pipeline
cabal v2-test --test-options="--match 'GHC.*Integration'"
```

### Performance Testing

Verify timeout and resource behavior:

```haskell
it "respects evaluation timeouts" $ do
  -- Test infinite loop with timeout
  result <- evaluateExpressionWithTimeout 1 "let loop = loop in loop"
  case result of
    Left (TimeoutError _) -> return ()
    _ -> expectationFailure "Expected timeout error"
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: hint Module Not Found

**Error**: `Could not find module 'Language.Haskell.Interpreter'`

**Solution**: Check `hs-jupyter-kernel.cabal` contains:

```cabal
build-depends: hint >= 0.9.0
```

### Issue 2: GHC Version Mismatch

**Error**: `hint` package requires different GHC version

**Solution**: Verify GHC version compatibility:

```bash
ghc --version  # Should be 9.12.2
cabal v2-build --dependencies-only
```

### Issue 3: STM Integration Issues

**Error**: `hint` operations block STM transactions

**Solution**: Use `liftIO` to lift hint operations:

```haskell
evaluateInSTM :: Text -> STM (IO (Either GHCError Text))
evaluateInSTM code = return $ evaluateExpression code
```

### Issue 4: Resource Limits Not Applied

**Error**: GHC operations ignore existing resource limits

**Solution**: Wrap hint calls with existing ResourceGuard:

```haskell
import HsJupyter.Runtime.ResourceGuard

evaluateWithLimits :: Text -> ResourceM (Either GHCError Text)
evaluateWithLimits code = withResourceGuard $ evaluateExpression code
```

## Next Steps

After completing this quickstart:

1. **Run full test suite**: Ensure all existing tests pass
2. **Manual testing**: Test basic expressions in actual notebook
3. **Performance validation**: Verify timeout behavior
4. **Error handling**: Test various error scenarios

### Ready for Tasks Phase

Once quickstart validation is complete:

```bash
# Generate task breakdown
/speckit.tasks

# Begin implementation following task list
/speckit.implement
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Basic expression evaluation works: `2 + 3` ‚Üí `5`
- [ ] Error handling works: `1 + "hello"` ‚Üí meaningful error
- [ ] Integration preserves existing functionality: all Phase 2 tests pass
- [ ] Performance meets targets: simple expressions < 200ms
- [ ] STM integration works: no deadlocks or race conditions

This quickstart provides the foundation for full GHC evaluation implementation while maintaining all existing Phase 2 functionality.

# Research: GHC Evaluation Integration

**Feature**: 003-ghc-evaluation | **Date**: 2024-10-25

## Research Tasks

Based on technical context analysis, the following areas required research:

1. **hint library integration patterns** - How to integrate hint InterpreterT with existing STM architecture
2. **GHC resource management** - Combining hint timeouts with ResourceGuard system
3. **Persistent interpreter state** - Managing Haskell bindings across cell executions
4. **Error handling integration** - Mapping GHC errors to RuntimeDiagnostic system
5. **Module import security** - Implementing configurable whitelist for safe imports

## Findings

### 1. hint Library Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Use hint's `InterpreterT` monad transformer stacked with STM for thread-safe state management

**Rationale**:

- hint provides `InterpreterT` monad transformer that can be stacked with other monads
- STM operations can be lifted into InterpreterT using `liftIO . atomically`
- Allows preserving existing STM-based job queue and cancellation patterns
- hint's `runInterpreter` provides clean error handling via `InterpreterError`

**Alternatives considered**:

- Raw GHC API: Too complex, hint provides safer abstraction
- Separate hint process: Added complexity, communication overhead
- Synchronous hint calls: Would block STM, chosen async approach with STM coordination

**Implementation approach**:

```haskell
type GHCRuntime = ReaderT GHCConfig (InterpreterT (STM))

runGHCEvaluation :: GHCRuntime a -> STM (Either InterpreterError a)
```

### 2. GHC Resource Management

**Decision**: Implement timeout wrapper around hint operations combined with existing ResourceGuard monitoring

**Rationale**:

- hint library supports timeout via `System.Timeout.timeout`
- ResourceGuard already monitors memory/CPU at process level
- Differentiated timeouts align with clarified requirements (1s/5s/10s)
- TMVar cancellation can interrupt hint operations

**Alternatives considered**:

- hint-only timeouts: Insufficient, lacks memory monitoring
- ResourceGuard-only: Cannot interrupt GHC compilation mid-process
- Separate resource system: Violates DRY principle, adds complexity

**Implementation approach**:

```haskell
timeoutGHCOperation :: Int -> InterpreterT IO a -> InterpreterT IO (Maybe a)
timeoutGHCOperation seconds action = liftIO $ timeout (seconds * 1000000) (runInterpreter action)
```

### 3. Persistent Interpreter State

**Decision**: Maintain single hint `Interpreter` instance per session with STM-managed state tracking

**Rationale**:

- hint `Interpreter` naturally maintains variable bindings across `interpret` calls
- STM `TVar (Set String)` can track defined variables for cleanup/reset
- Supports clarified requirement for top-level binding persistence
- Local bindings automatically cleaned up by GHC scoping

**Alternatives considered**:

- New interpreter per cell: Loses state persistence, startup overhead
- Manual state serialization: Complex, error-prone, unnecessary with hint
- Global interpreter: Thread safety issues, conflicts with STM model

**Implementation approach**:

```haskell
data GHCSessionState = GHCSessionState
  { interpreterHandle :: Interpreter
  , definedBindings :: TVar (Set String)
  , importedModules :: TVar [ModuleName]
  }
```

### 4. Error Handling Integration

**Decision**: Map hint `InterpreterError` to existing `RuntimeDiagnostic` with GHC-specific error enrichment

**Rationale**:

- hint provides structured error types: `UnknownError`, `WrongImportStyle`, `NotAllowed`, `GhcException`
- `RuntimeDiagnostic` already supports severity levels and structured messages
- GHC errors contain location information that maps to diagnostic context
- Preserves existing error handling patterns

**Alternatives considered**:

- Direct hint errors: Inconsistent with existing diagnostic system
- New error system: Violates existing architecture, duplicates functionality
- Error translation layer: Chosen approach, maintains consistency

**Implementation approach**:

```haskell
ghcErrorToDiagnostic :: InterpreterError -> RuntimeDiagnostic
ghcErrorToDiagnostic (WrongImportStyle m) = RuntimeDiagnostic
  { severity = Error
  , message = "Import style error for module: " <> m
  , context = Just ("module", m)
  }
```

### 5. Module Import Security

**Decision**: Implement configurable whitelist with default safe modules, extensible via configuration

**Rationale**:

- Addresses clarified security requirement for import restrictions
- Standard library modules (Data.*, Control.*, Text.*) are generally safe
- System modules (System.Process, Network.*) require restriction
- Configuration allows customization for different deployment environments

**Alternatives considered**:

- Blacklist approach: Incomplete, new unsafe modules could be added
- No restrictions: Security risk for hosted environments
- User approval per import: Too restrictive for interactive use

**Implementation approach**:

```haskell
data ImportPolicy = ImportPolicy
  { allowedModules :: Set ModuleName
  , deniedModules :: Set ModuleName
  , defaultPolicy :: ImportDefault -- Allow | Deny
  }

defaultSafeModules :: Set ModuleName
defaultSafeModules = Set.fromList
  [ "Data.List", "Data.Map", "Data.Set", "Control.Monad"
  , "Control.Applicative", "Text.Printf", "System.IO"
  ]
```

## Architecture Integration

### STM Integration Pattern

The hint `InterpreterT` will be integrated with STM using this pattern:

```haskell
-- Existing STM job queue unchanged
data RuntimeJob = RuntimeJob
  { jobId :: JobId
  , jobAction :: IO RuntimeResult  -- hint operations lifted to IO
  , jobCancel :: TMVar ()
  }

-- GHC evaluation wraps hint in STM-compatible IO
evaluateGHC :: GHCSessionState -> Text -> STM (STM RuntimeResult)
evaluateGHC session code = do
  jobId <- generateJobId
  cancelToken <- newEmptyTMVar
  let action = runGHCWithTimeout session code cancelToken
  return $ liftIO action
```

### Performance Characteristics

Based on research and existing Phase 2 benchmarks:

- **hint initialization**: ~500ms (acceptable for session startup <2s target)
- **Simple expression evaluation**: ~50-100ms (well under 200ms target)
- **Module import**: ~200-800ms per module (under 2s target with 5s timeout)
- **Memory overhead**: ~20-40MB for hint interpreter (acceptable with 100MB baseline)

### Testing Strategy

Research confirms comprehensive testing approach:

1. **Unit tests**: Mock hint operations, test error mapping, timeout behavior
2. **Integration tests**: Real hint interpreter, standard library usage
3. **Performance tests**: Timeout verification, memory profiling
4. **Security tests**: Import policy enforcement, unsafe module blocking

## Next Steps

Phase 0 research complete. All technical unknowns resolved with concrete implementation approaches. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 design (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md).

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure extending existing HsJupyter.Runtime.* namespace. New GHC components integrate with existing STM-based architecture while preserving all Phase 2 infrastructure (cancellation, resource limits, diagnostics).

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

No constitution violations identified. All complexity is justified by requirements:

- hint library integration: Simplest path to GHC evaluation vs raw GHC API
- New modules: Required for GHC functionality, following existing namespace patterns
- STM integration: Preserves existing concurrency model, maintains consistency

---

## Plan Status

**Phase 0**: ‚úÖ Complete - Research resolved all technical unknowns  
**Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Complete - Design artifacts generated (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md)  
**Phase 2**: ‚è≥ Ready for `/speckit.tasks` to generate implementation tasks  

**Generated Artifacts**:

- `research.md` - hint integration patterns, resource management, state persistence
- `data-model.md` - Complete entity model with validation rules and integration points  
- `contracts/api-specification.md` - Haskell module interfaces and backwards compatibility
- `quickstart.md` - Step-by-step implementation guide with testing strategy

**Next Command**: `/speckit.tasks` to break down implementation into concrete tasks
# GHC Evaluation API Contracts

**Feature**: 003-ghc-evaluation | **Date**: 2024-10-25

## Overview

This document defines the internal API contracts for GHC evaluation integration. These are Haskell module interfaces, not REST/HTTP APIs, as this feature extends the existing kernel runtime.

## Core Module Contracts

### HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCRuntime

**Purpose**: Main interface for GHC-based code evaluation

```haskell
module HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCRuntime
  ( -- * Core evaluation functions
    evaluateExpression
  , evaluateDeclaration  
  , importModule
    
    -- * Session management
  , initializeGHCSession
  , resetGHCSession
  , getSessionBindings
    
    -- * Configuration
  , GHCConfig(..)
  , defaultGHCConfig
  ) where

-- | Evaluate a Haskell expression and return its result
evaluateExpression :: GHCSessionState -> Text -> STM (Either GHCError Text)

-- | Execute a Haskell declaration (variable/function definition)
evaluateDeclaration :: GHCSessionState -> Text -> STM (Either GHCError [String])

-- | Import a Haskell module with security policy checking
importModule :: GHCSessionState -> ModuleName -> STM (Either GHCError ())

-- | Initialize a new GHC session with configuration
initializeGHCSession :: GHCConfig -> STM (Either GHCError GHCSessionState)

-- | Reset session state while preserving interpreter instance
resetGHCSession :: GHCSessionState -> STM ()

-- | Get list of currently defined bindings
getSessionBindings :: GHCSessionState -> STM [String]
```

### HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCSession

**Purpose**: Session state management and persistence

```haskell
module HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCSession
  ( -- * Session state types
    GHCSessionState(..)
  , GHCConfig(..)
  , ImportPolicy(..)
    
    -- * State operations
  , addBinding
  , removeBinding
  , listBindings
  , addImportedModule
  , listImportedModules
    
    -- * Session lifecycle
  , withGHCSession
  , cleanupSession
  ) where

data GHCSessionState = GHCSessionState
  { interpreterHandle :: Interpreter
  , definedBindings :: TVar (Set String)
  , importedModules :: TVar [ModuleName]
  , sessionConfig :: GHCConfig
  }

data GHCConfig = GHCConfig
  { expressionTimeout :: Int
  , compilationTimeout :: Int
  , computationTimeout :: Int
  , importPolicy :: ImportPolicy
  , resourceLimits :: ResourceConfig
  }

-- | Add a new binding to the session state
addBinding :: GHCSessionState -> String -> STM ()

-- | Remove a binding from the session state
removeBinding :: GHCSessionState -> String -> STM ()

-- | Execute action with managed GHC session
withGHCSession :: GHCConfig -> (GHCSessionState -> STM a) -> STM (Either GHCError a)
```

### HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCDiagnostics

**Purpose**: Error handling and diagnostic reporting

```haskell
module HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCDiagnostics
  ( -- * Error types
    GHCError(..)
  , GHCErrorType(..)
  , SourceLocation(..)
    
    -- * Error conversion
  , interpretError
  , ghcErrorToDiagnostic
  , enrichDiagnostic
    
    -- * Suggestion system
  , generateSuggestions
  , commonErrorSuggestions
  ) where

data GHCError
  = CompilationError Text SourceLocation [Text]
  | RuntimeError Text
  | TimeoutError Int
  | ImportError ModuleName Text
  | SecurityError Text
  deriving (Show, Eq)

data SourceLocation = SourceLocation
  { sourceLine :: Int
  , sourceColumn :: Int
  , sourceFile :: Maybe FilePath
  } deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | Convert hint InterpreterError to GHCError
interpretError :: InterpreterError -> GHCError

-- | Convert GHCError to RuntimeDiagnostic for Phase 2 integration
ghcErrorToDiagnostic :: GHCError -> RuntimeDiagnostic

-- | Generate helpful suggestions for common errors
generateSuggestions :: GHCError -> [Text]
```

## Integration Contracts

### Runtime Manager Integration

**Purpose**: Integration with existing Phase 2 RuntimeManager

```haskell
-- Extension to existing HsJupyter.Runtime.Manager
module HsJupyter.Runtime.Manager where

-- | Execute GHC evaluation job (extends existing executeJob)
executeGHCJob :: JobId -> GHCEvaluationRequest -> RuntimeM RuntimeResult

-- | Initialize GHC runtime alongside existing runtime components
initializeGHCRuntime :: RuntimeConfig -> RuntimeM ()

-- | Shutdown GHC runtime and cleanup resources
shutdownGHCRuntime :: RuntimeM ()
```

### Job Queue Integration

**Purpose**: Integration with existing STM-based job queue

```haskell
-- Extension to existing job types
data RuntimeJob
  = EchoJob JobId Text (TMVar RuntimeResult)
  | GHCJob JobId GHCEvaluationRequest (TMVar RuntimeResult)  -- NEW
  | DiagnosticJob JobId DiagnosticRequest (TMVar RuntimeResult)

-- GHC job processing
processGHCJob :: GHCSessionState -> GHCEvaluationRequest -> STM RuntimeResult
```

## Request/Response Contracts

### GHC Evaluation Request

```haskell
data GHCEvaluationRequest = GHCEvaluationRequest
  { reqCode :: Text
  , reqType :: EvaluationType
  , reqSessionId :: SessionId
  , reqTimeout :: Maybe Int
  } deriving (Show, Eq)

data EvaluationType
  = Expression      -- Return computed value
  | Declaration     -- Define variable/function
  | Import         -- Import module
  deriving (Show, Eq)
```

### GHC Evaluation Response

```haskell
data GHCEvaluationResult = GHCEvaluationResult
  { resSuccess :: Bool
  , resResult :: Maybe Text
  , resOutput :: Text
  , resDiagnostics :: [RuntimeDiagnostic]
  , resBindingsAdded :: [String]
  , resModulesImported :: [ModuleName]
  } deriving (Show, Eq)
```

## Security Contracts

### Import Policy Interface

```haskell
module HsJupyter.Runtime.ImportPolicy where

data ImportPolicy = ImportPolicy
  { allowedModules :: Set ModuleName
  , deniedModules :: Set ModuleName
  , defaultPolicy :: ImportDefault
  , systemModulesAllowed :: Bool
  }

data ImportDefault = Allow | Deny deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | Check if module import is allowed by policy
checkImportAllowed :: ImportPolicy -> ModuleName -> Bool

-- | Default safe module configuration
defaultSafePolicy :: ImportPolicy

-- | Default restrictive configuration for production
defaultRestrictivePolicy :: ImportPolicy
```

## Performance Contracts

### Timeout Management

```haskell
module HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCTimeout where

-- | Apply timeout to GHC operation based on type
withGHCTimeout :: EvaluationType -> GHCConfig -> IO a -> IO (Maybe a)

-- | Cancel GHC operation via TMVar signal
cancelGHCOperation :: TMVar () -> IO a -> IO (Either CancelledError a)

-- | Combine timeout and cancellation
withTimeoutAndCancellation :: Int -> TMVar () -> IO a -> IO (Either GHCError a)
```

### Resource Monitoring

```haskell
-- Integration with existing ResourceGuard
monitorGHCResources :: GHCSessionState -> IO a -> IO (Either ResourceError a)

-- Resource limits specific to GHC operations
data GHCResourceLimits = GHCResourceLimits
  { maxMemoryMB :: Int
  , maxCPUTimeSeconds :: Int
  , maxOutputBytes :: Int
  }
```

## Testing Contracts

### Mock Interfaces

```haskell
module HsJupyter.Runtime.GHCRuntime.Mock where

-- | Mock GHC runtime for unit testing
data MockGHCRuntime = MockGHCRuntime
  { mockEvaluationResults :: [Either GHCError Text]
  , mockBindings :: [String]
  , mockImports :: [ModuleName]
  }

-- | Create mock runtime with predefined responses
createMockRuntime :: MockGHCRuntime -> GHCSessionState

-- | Verify mock runtime received expected calls
verifyMockCalls :: MockGHCRuntime -> [GHCEvaluationRequest] -> Bool
```

## Backwards Compatibility

### Phase 2 Compatibility

All existing Phase 2 interfaces remain unchanged:

- `RuntimeManager` continues to handle job dispatch
- `SessionState` is extended, not replaced
- `RuntimeDiagnostic` system is reused for GHC errors
- STM-based job queue accepts new GHCJob type
- ResourceGuard monitoring applies to GHC operations

### Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Add GHC modules alongside existing EchoRuntime
2. **Phase 2**: Runtime Manager dispatches to both Echo and GHC based on configuration
3. **Phase 3**: Default to GHC runtime, maintain Echo for testing/fallback
4. **Phase 4**: Deprecate EchoRuntime (future consideration)

The contract ensures zero breaking changes to existing functionality while adding comprehensive GHC evaluation capabilities.
# Feature Specification: GHC Evaluation

**Feature ID**: 003-ghc-evaluation  
**Priority**: P1 (Critical - Core Functionality)  
**Status**: Specification Phase  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 Runtime Core (Complete)

## Executive Summary

Transform HsJupyter from an advanced echo server into a functional Haskell REPL by integrating real GHC evaluation capabilities. This phase replaces the current echo-based evaluation with actual Haskell compilation and execution using the `hint` library, enabling users to write, execute, and iterate on Haskell code in Jupyter notebooks.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

Currently, HsJupyter can only echo back the code users type without actually executing Haskell expressions. Users cannot:

- Evaluate Haskell expressions and see computed results
- Define variables and functions that persist across notebook cells
- Import Haskell modules and use library functions
- Get meaningful error messages from actual compilation failures
- Experience the interactive development workflow that makes Jupyter valuable

### Success Vision

Users can write authentic Haskell code in Jupyter notebooks with:

- **Real Evaluation**: `2 + 3` returns `5`, not `"2 + 3"`
- **State Persistence**: Variables defined in one cell are available in subsequent cells
- **Module System**: Import and use standard Haskell libraries
- **Error Feedback**: Compilation errors with line/column information
- **Interactive Development**: Fast edit-evaluate-debug cycles

### Stakeholder Value

- **Haskell Learners**: Interactive environment for learning functional programming
- **Data Scientists**: Haskell-based data analysis and visualization workflows
- **Educators**: Teaching platform for functional programming concepts
- **Researchers**: Reproducible computational notebooks with strong type safety

## User Stories

     factorial n = if n <= 1 
                   then 1 
                   else n * factorial (n-1)
     ```
   - **When** I execute cell 1 successfully
   - **And** I enter `factorial 5` in cell 2
   - **And** I execute cell 2
   - **Then** I see the result `120`

### User Story 3: Module Import System (P2)

   - **Then** I see the result `True`

### User Story 4: Error Handling and Diagnostics (P2)

**As a** developer debugging Haskell code  
**I want** clear, actionable error messages when compilation fails  
**So that** I can quickly identify and fix problems

**Acceptance Scenarios:**

1. **Syntax Errors**
   - **Given** I enter invalid syntax like `let x = ]` in a cell
   - **When** I execute the cell
   - **Then** I see a parse error with line/column information
   - **And** the error message suggests how to fix the syntax

2. **Type Errors**
   - **Given** I enter `length "hello" + "world"` in a cell
   - **When** I execute the cell
   - **Then** I see a type error explaining the mismatch
   - **And** the error includes the expected and actual types

3. **Undefined Variables**
   - **Given** I enter `unknownVariable + 1` in a cell
   - **When** I execute the cell
   - **Then** I see an "undefined variable" error
   - **And** the error points to the specific variable name

### User Story 5: Performance and Resource Management (P3)

**As a** notebook user  
**I want** evaluation to complete in reasonable time with controlled resource usage  
**So that** I can work efficiently without system overload

**Acceptance Scenarios:**

1. **Responsive Simple Expressions**
   - **Given** I enter a simple arithmetic expression
   - **When** I execute the cell
   - **Then** the result appears within 1 second

2. **Timeout Protection**
   - **Given** I enter an infinite loop like `let loop = loop in loop`
   - **When** I execute the cell
   - **Then** execution is cancelled after 10 seconds (complex computation timeout)
   - **And** I receive a timeout error message

3. **Memory Limits**
   - **Given** I enter code that would consume excessive memory
   - **When** I execute the cell
   - **Then** execution is terminated if memory limits are exceeded

**Specification Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and Ready for Implementation Planning
**Next Phase**: Generate implementation plan with `/speckit.plan`---
description: Identify underspecified areas in the current feature spec by asking up to 5 highly targeted clarification questions and encoding answers back into the spec.
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

Goal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.

Note: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/speckit.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.

Execution steps:

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:
   - `FEATURE_DIR`
   - `FEATURE_SPEC`
   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)
   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).

   Functional Scope & Behavior:
   - Core user goals & success criteria
   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations
   - User roles / personas differentiation

   Domain & Data Model:
   - Entities, attributes, relationships
   - Identity & uniqueness rules
   - Lifecycle/state transitions
   - Data volume / scale assumptions

   Interaction & UX Flow:
   - Critical user journeys / sequences
   - Error/empty/loading states
   - Accessibility or localization notes

   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:
   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)
   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)
   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)
   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)
   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)
   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)

   Integration & External Dependencies:
   - External services/APIs and failure modes
   - Data import/export formats
   - Protocol/versioning assumptions

   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:
   - Negative scenarios
   - Rate limiting / throttling
   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)

   Constraints & Tradeoffs:
   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)
   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives

   Terminology & Consistency:
   - Canonical glossary terms
   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms

   Completion Signals:
   - Acceptance criteria testability
   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators

   Misc / Placeholders:
   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions
   - Ambiguous adjectives ("robust", "intuitive") lacking quantification

   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:
   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy
   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)

3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:
    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.
    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:
       - A short multiple‚Äëchoice selection (2‚Äì5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR
       - A one-word / short‚Äëphrase answer (explicitly constrain: "Answer in <=5 words").
    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.
    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.
    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).
    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.
    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.

4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):
    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.
    - For multiple‚Äëchoice questions:
       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:
          - Best practices for the project type
          - Common patterns in similar implementations
          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)
          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec
       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).
       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`
       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:

       | Option | Description |
       |--------|-------------|
       | A | <Option A description> |
       | B | <Option B description> |
       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |
       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |

       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own short answer.`
    - For short‚Äëanswer style (no meaningful discrete options):
       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.
       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`
       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying "yes" or "suggested", or provide your own answer.`
    - After the user answers:
       - If the user replies with "yes", "recommended", or "suggested", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.
       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.
       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).
       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.
    - Stop asking further questions when:
       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR
       - User signals completion ("done", "good", "no more"), OR
       - You reach 5 asked questions.
    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.
    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.

5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):
    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.
    - For the first integrated answer in this session:
       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).
       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.
    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> ‚Üí A: <final answer>`.
    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):
       - Functional ambiguity ‚Üí Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.
       - User interaction / actor distinction ‚Üí Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.
       - Data shape / entities ‚Üí Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.
       - Non-functional constraint ‚Üí Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).
       - Edge case / negative flow ‚Üí Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).
       - Terminology conflict ‚Üí Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as "X")` once.
    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.
    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).
    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.
    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).

6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):
   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).
   - Total asked (accepted) questions ‚â§ 5.
   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.
   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).
   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.

7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.

8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):
   - Number of questions asked & answered.
   - Path to updated spec.
   - Sections touched (list names).
   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).
   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.
   - Suggested next command.

Behavior rules:

- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: "No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification." and suggest proceeding.
- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).
- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).
- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.
- Respect user early termination signals ("stop", "done", "proceed").
- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.
- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.

Context for prioritization: $ARGUMENTS
---
description: Create or update the feature specification from a natural language feature description.
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `$ARGUMENTS` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:
   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature
   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)
   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance
   - Examples:
     - "I want to add user authentication" ‚Üí "user-auth"
     - "Implement OAuth2 integration for the API" ‚Üí "oauth2-api-integration"
     - "Create a dashboard for analytics" ‚Üí "analytics-dashboard"
     - "Fix payment processing timeout bug" ‚Üí "fix-payment-timeout"

2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:
   
   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:
      ```bash
      git fetch --all --prune
      ```
   
   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:
      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`
   
   c. Determine the next available number:
      - Extract all numbers from all three sources
      - Find the highest number N
      - Use N+1 for the new branch number
   
   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$ARGUMENTS"` with the calculated number and short-name:
      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name "your-short-name"` along with the feature description
      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$ARGUMENTS" --json --number 5 --short-name "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`
      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$ARGUMENTS" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`
   
   **IMPORTANT**:
   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number
   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern
   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1
   - You must only ever run this script once per feature
   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for
   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot")

3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.

4. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user description from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
    2. Extract key concepts from description
       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
       If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
    5. Generate Functional Requirements
       Each requirement must be testable
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)
    6. Define Success Criteria
       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)
       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details
    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:

      ```markdown
      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]
      
      ## Content Quality
      
      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed
      
      ## Requirement Completeness
      
      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable
      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
      - [ ] Edge cases are identified
      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified
      
      ## Feature Readiness
      
      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification
      
      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:

      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6

      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the spec to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user

      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.

## General Guidelines

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.
- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience
   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)
   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)
   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):

- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain
- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified
- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks
- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps
- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise

### Success Criteria Guidelines

Success criteria must be:

1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)
2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools
3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals
4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details

**Good examples**:

- "Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes"
- "System supports 10,000 concurrent users"
- "95% of searches return results in under 1 second"
- "Task completion rate improves by 40%"

**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):

- "API response time is under 200ms" (too technical, use "Users see results instantly")
- "Database can handle 1000 TPS" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)
- "React components render efficiently" (framework-specific)
- "Redis cache hit rate above 80%" (technology-specific)

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per story
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
   - Total task count
   - Task count per user story
   - Parallel opportunities identified
   - Independent test criteria for each story
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label  
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ‚ùå WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)
- ‚ùå WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- ‚ùå WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
- ‚ùå WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each contract/endpoint ‚Üí to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each contract ‚Üí contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships ‚Üí service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure ‚Üí Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks ‚Üí Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup ‚Üí within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Endpoints ‚Üí Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

description: Generate a custom checklist for the current feature based on user requirements.
---

## Checklist Purpose: "Unit Tests for English"

**CRITICAL CONCEPT**: Checklists are **UNIT TESTS FOR REQUIREMENTS WRITING** - they validate the quality, clarity, and completeness of requirements in a given domain.

**NOT for verification/testing**:

- ‚ùå NOT "Verify the button clicks correctly"
- ‚ùå NOT "Test error handling works"
- ‚ùå NOT "Confirm the API returns 200"
- ‚ùå NOT checking if code/implementation matches the spec

**FOR requirements quality validation**:

- ‚úÖ "Are visual hierarchy requirements defined for all card types?" (completeness)
- ‚úÖ "Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?" (clarity)
- ‚úÖ "Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?" (consistency)
- ‚úÖ "Are accessibility requirements defined for keyboard navigation?" (coverage)
- ‚úÖ "Does the spec define what happens when logo image fails to load?" (edge cases)

**Metaphor**: If your spec is code written in English, the checklist is its unit test suite. You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.
   - All file paths must be absolute.
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:
   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks
   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content
   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in `$ARGUMENTS`
   - Prefer precision over breadth

   Generation algorithm:
   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators ("critical", "must", "compliance"), stakeholder hints ("QA", "review", "security team"), and explicit deliverables ("a11y", "rollback", "contracts").
   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.
   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.
   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.
   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:
      - Scope refinement (e.g., "Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?")
      - Risk prioritization (e.g., "Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?")
      - Depth calibration (e.g., "Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?")
      - Audience framing (e.g., "Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?")
      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., "Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?")
      - Scenario class gap (e.g., "No recovery flows detected‚Äîare rollback / partial failure paths in scope?")

   Question formatting rules:
   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters
   - Limit to A‚ÄìE options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer
   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said
   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: "Confirm whether X belongs in scope."

   Defaults when interaction impossible:
   - Depth: Standard
   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise
   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters

   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ‚â•2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‚Äëups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., "Unresolved recovery path risk"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.

3. **Understand user request**: Combine `$ARGUMENTS` + clarifying answers:
   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)
   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user
   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding
   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)

4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope
   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies
   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks

   **Context Loading Strategy**:
   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)
   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets
   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected
   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text

5. **Generate checklist** - Create "Unit Tests for Requirements":
   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Generate unique checklist filename:
     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)
     - Format: `[domain].md`
     - If file exists, append to existing file
   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001
   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)

   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:
   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:
   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?
   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?
   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?
   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?
   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?

   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:
   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)
   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)
   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)
   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)
   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)
   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)
   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)
   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)
   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)

   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - "Unit Tests for English"**:

   ‚ùå **WRONG** (Testing implementation):
   - "Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards"
   - "Test hover states work on desktop"
   - "Confirm logo click navigates home"

   ‚úÖ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):
   - "Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?" [Completeness]
   - "Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?" [Clarity]
   - "Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?" [Consistency]
   - "Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?" [Coverage]
   - "Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?" [Edge Cases]
   - "Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?" [Completeness]
   - "Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?" [Clarity]

   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:
   Each item should follow this pattern:
   - Question format asking about requirement quality
   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan
   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]
   - Reference spec section `[Spec ¬ßX.Y]` when checking existing requirements
   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements

   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:

   Completeness:
   - "Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes? [Gap]"
   - "Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Completeness]"
   - "Are mobile breakpoint requirements defined for responsive layouts? [Gap]"

   Clarity:
   - "Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec ¬ßNFR-2]"
   - "Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec ¬ßFR-5]"
   - "Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec ¬ßFR-4]"

   Consistency:
   - "Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec ¬ßFR-10]"
   - "Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]"

   Coverage:
   - "Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]"
   - "Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]"
   - "Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]"

   Measurability:
   - "Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec ¬ßFR-1]"
   - "Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec ¬ßFR-2]"

   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):
   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios
   - For each scenario class, ask: "Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?"
   - If scenario class missing: "Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]"
   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: "Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]"

   **Traceability Requirements**:
   - MINIMUM: ‚â•80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference
   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec ¬ßX.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`
   - If no ID system exists: "Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]"

   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):
   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:
   - Ambiguities: "Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec ¬ßNFR-1]"
   - Conflicts: "Do navigation requirements conflict between ¬ßFR-10 and ¬ßFR-10a? [Conflict]"
   - Assumptions: "Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]"
   - Dependencies: "Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]"
   - Missing definitions: "Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]"

   **Content Consolidation**:
   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact
   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect
   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: "Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]"

   **üö´ ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:
   - ‚ùå Any item starting with "Verify", "Test", "Confirm", "Check" + implementation behavior
   - ‚ùå References to code execution, user actions, system behavior
   - ‚ùå "Displays correctly", "works properly", "functions as expected"
   - ‚ùå "Click", "navigate", "render", "load", "execute"
   - ‚ùå Test cases, test plans, QA procedures
   - ‚ùå Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)

   **‚úÖ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:
   - ‚úÖ "Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?"
   - ‚úÖ "Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?"
   - ‚úÖ "Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?"
   - ‚úÖ "Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?"
   - ‚úÖ "Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?"
   - ‚úÖ "Does the spec define [missing aspect]?"

6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.

7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:
   - Focus areas selected
   - Depth level
   - Actor/timing
   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated

**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:

- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)
- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose
- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder

To avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.

## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items

**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`

Sample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):

- "Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria? [Clarity, Spec ¬ßFR-1]"

- "Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]"
- "Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]"

## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do

**‚ùå WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**

```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec ¬ßFR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec ¬ßFR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec ¬ßFR-010]
- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec ¬ßFR-005]
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**

```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec ¬ßFR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec ¬ßFR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec ¬ßFR-010]
- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented? [Gap, Spec ¬ßFR-005]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are loading state requirements defined for asynchronous episode data? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK006 - Can "visual hierarchy" requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec ¬ßFR-001]
```

**Key Differences:**

- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly
- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly
- Wrong: Verification of behavior
- Correct: Validation of requirement quality
- Wrong: "Does it do X?"
- Correct: "Is X clearly specified?"

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION ‚Üí research task
   - For each dependency ‚Üí best practices task
   - For each integration ‚Üí patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** ‚Üí `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action ‚Üí endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

description: Perform a non-destructive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md after task generation.
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Identify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation. This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).

**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks‚Äînot dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Initialize Analysis Context

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:

- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md
- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md
- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md

Abort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).
For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)

Load only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:

**From spec.md:**

- Overview/Context
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- User Stories
- Edge Cases (if present)

**From plan.md:**

- Architecture/stack choices
- Data Model references
- Phases
- Technical constraints

**From tasks.md:**

- Task IDs
- Descriptions
- Phase grouping
- Parallel markers [P]
- Referenced file paths

**From constitution:**

- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation

### 3. Build Semantic Models

Create internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):

- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., "User can upload file" ‚Üí `user-can-upload-file`)
- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria
- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)
- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements

### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)

Focus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.

#### A. Duplication Detection

- Identify near-duplicate requirements
- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation

#### B. Ambiguity Detection

- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria
- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)

#### C. Underspecification

- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome
- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment
- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan

#### D. Constitution Alignment

- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle
- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution

#### E. Coverage Gaps

- Requirements with zero associated tasks
- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story
- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)

#### F. Inconsistency

- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)
- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)
- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)
- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)

### 5. Severity Assignment

Use this heuristic to prioritize findings:

- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality
- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion
- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case
- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order

### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report

Output a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:

## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |

(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)

**Coverage Summary Table:**

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|

**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)

**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)

**Metrics:**

- Total Requirements
- Total Tasks
- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)
- Ambiguity Count
- Duplication Count
- Critical Issues Count

### 7. Provide Next Actions

At end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:

- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`
- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions
- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., "Run /speckit.specify with refinement", "Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture", "Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'"

### 8. Offer Remediation

Ask the user: "Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)

## Operating Principles

### Context Efficiency

- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis
- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow
- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts

### Analysis Guidelines

- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)
- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)
- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)
- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)
- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)

## Context

$ARGUMENTS
---
description: Create or update the project constitution from interactive or provided principle inputs, ensuring all dependent templates stay in sync
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.

Follow this execution flow:

1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).
   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

3. Draft the updated constitution content:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet‚Äîexplicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‚Äënegotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):
   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any "Constitution Check" or rules align with updated principles.
   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment‚Äîupdate if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.
   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).
   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.
   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.

5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):
   - Version change: old ‚Üí new
   - List of modified principles (old title ‚Üí new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Templates requiring updates (‚úÖ updated / ‚ö† pending) with file paths
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

6. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" ‚Üí replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).

8. Output a final summary to the user with:
   - New version and bump rationale.
   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.
   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).

Formatting & Style Requirements:

- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Do not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:

     ```text
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ‚úì PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ‚úó FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ‚úì PASS |
     ```

   - Calculate overall status:
     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items

   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     - Display the table with incomplete item counts
     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3

   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     - Display the table showing all checklists passed
     - Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:

   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null

5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

7. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

8. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

9. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

Try to pay attention when implementing tests, so that they are not wrong. Many times tests are written incorrectly and give false positives or false negatives, which can mislead development efforts.
When writing code, always consider edge cases and error handling to ensure robustness.
Never forget DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles to keep the codebase simple, maintainable and efficient.
When documenting code, ensure clarity and completeness to facilitate future maintenance and onboarding.
Pay attention to the prompts and instructions so that you do everything correctly and nothing is missed.
# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

HsJupyter is documentation-first while the kernel takes shape. Keep architecture decisions in `docs/architecture.md`, roadmap updates in `docs/roadmap.md`, and contributor process notes in `docs/developer/`. When adding implementation drafts, stage them under clearly named branches and mirror the planned components (`KernelProcess`, `JupyterBridge`, `RuntimeManager`) so the eventual `src/` tree remains predictable. Update diagrams or reference tables alongside the written guidance they support.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use a GHC toolchain installed via `ghcup` (`ghcup install ghc 9.12.2 cabal`) before standing up prototypes.

**‚ö° Performance Note**: Full builds take several minutes due to the hint library (GHC API). For faster development:

- `cabal build lib:hs-jupyter-kernel -O0` (5 seconds vs minutes)
- `cabal test unit -O0 --test-option="--match=/ModuleName/"` (targeted tests)
- Configure `jobs: 4` and `documentation: False` in cabal.project for parallel builds

Build emerging packages with `cabal v2-build` or `cabal v2-repl` and record any extra flags in your PR. Run documentation checks locally‚Äî`markdownlint docs/**/*.md README.md`‚Äîto keep the published guides consistent. Prototype scripts (e.g., ZeroMQ harnesses) should live under `.specify/scripts/` with executable bits set (`chmod +x .specify/scripts/dev-kernel.sh`) and usage documented.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow four-space indentation for Haskell and keep modules under the `HsJupyter.*` namespace. Prefer descriptive, singular record names (`KernelProcessConfig`) and camel-cased constructors. Rely on total, pure functions where possible, and annotate tricky sections with brief Haddock comments. Document formatting choices in the same PR if you introduce new tooling.

## Testing Guidelines

Adopt `hspec` suites once runtime code lands; mirror the module tree under `test/` with files like `RequestRouterSpec.hs`. Run `cabal v2-test` before opening a PR and attach coverage or sample output when CI is unavailable. For interim prototypes, include deterministic repro steps (`scripts/dev-kernel.sh --json`) and expected responses in the PR description.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Write commit subjects in the imperative mood (`Add runtime manager sketch`) and keep bodies focused on rationale or follow-ups. Reference roadmap checklist items (see `docs/roadmap.md`) or related issues directly in the PR. Each PR should summarise behaviour changes, list any doc updates, and include screenshots or logs for user-visible work. Flag open questions or future tasks as Markdown checklists so reviewers can track them.

## Agent Workflow & Prompt Usage

Codex agents must follow the Specify toolkit prompts before running `/speckit` commands: review the matching files in `.codex/prompts/` (`speckit.specify.md`, `speckit.plan.md`, `speckit.tasks.md`, `speckit.implement.md`) and apply their checklists verbatim. Always invoke the helper scripts under `.specify/scripts/bash/` from the repo root with the documented flags, keep feature branches numbered (`001-name`), and update generated checklists when validation status changes.

## Active Technologies

# HsJupyter

HsJupyter is a next-generation Jupyter kernel for the Haskell programming language. The project is currently in the design and planning phase while we build a streamlined installation experience and a modern runtime architecture.

## Features

- Persistent GHC-powered execution engine tuned for fast feedback loops
- Rich output handling (text, HTML, images) with extensible renderers
- Planned support for completions, widgets, diagnostics, and resource monitoring
- Distribution-first approach with prebuilt binaries and a one-command installer
- Architecture guided by DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles for maintainability

## Quickstart

Prereqs:

- GHC via ghcup: `ghcup install ghc 9.12.2 cabal`
- Python (optional) with `pyzmq` for the demo client

Build fast (dev mode):

```bash
cabal build lib:hs-jupyter-kernel -O0
```

Run the prototype kernel against a sample Jupyter connection file:

```bash
cabal v2-run hs-jupyter-kernel -- \
  --connection scripts/demo/sample-connection.json \
  --log-level Info
```

Run tests (targeted and full):

```bash
cabal test unit -O0 --test-option="--match=/GHCSession/"
cabal v2-test
```

Optional: drive an execute-echo roundtrip from Python (see `scripts/demo/README.md`).

## Documentation

- [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md)
- [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)
- [Developer Guide](docs/developer/README.md)
- [Installation (WIP)](docs/installation/README.md)
- Protocol references: <https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

Current prototype entrypoint: `app/KernelMain.hs`.

Run the echo demo against a Jupyter connection file:

```bash
cabal v2-run hs-jupyter-kernel -- \
  --connection scripts/demo/sample-connection.json \
  --log-level Info
```

CLI flags come from `app/KernelMain.hs`:

- `--connection FILE` ‚Äì path to the Jupyter connection file
- `--log-level (Debug|Info|Warn|Error)` ‚Äì overrides `HSJUPYTER_LOG_LEVEL`

## Status

- ‚úÖ Architecture, planning, and roadmap documentation
- üîÑ Implementation in progress (kernel bridge, runtime, tooling)
- ‚è≥ Installer, knowledge base, and benchmarking suite

Key modules implemented:

- `HsJupyter.KernelProcess` ‚Äì process lifecycle and socket management
- `HsJupyter.Bridge.*` ‚Äì ZeroMQ bridge, heartbeat, protocol envelopes/codecs
- `HsJupyter.Router.RequestRouter` ‚Äì request routing (scaffolded)
- `HsJupyter.Runtime.*` ‚Äì runtime manager, GHC session, diagnostics, telemetry

## CLI Reference

Binary: `hs-jupyter-kernel` (entrypoint in `app/KernelMain.hs`)

Flags:

- `--connection FILE` ‚Äî path to Jupyter connection JSON
- `--log-level Debug|Info|Warn|Error` ‚Äî overrides env

Environment:

- `HSJUPYTER_LOG_LEVEL` ‚Äî default log level when flag not provided

Exit messages are printed to stdout; structured logs and telemetry will be wired per `docs/architecture.md`.

## Demo: Python Client

Use the helper in `scripts/demo/` to exercise an `execute_request` roundtrip without a full Jupyter stack.

Prereq: `pip install pyzmq`

Steps:

- Terminal A: start the kernel

```bash
cabal v2-run hs-jupyter-kernel -- \
  --connection scripts/demo/sample-connection.json \
  --log-level Debug
```

- Terminal B: send an execute request

```bash
python3 scripts/demo/phase1_echo_notebook.py \
  --connection scripts/demo/sample-connection.json
```

The script prints reply frames and any iopub stream/output captured by the echo runtime.

Excerpt (simplified) from `scripts/demo/phase1_echo_notebook.py` showing how the execute_request is built and signed:

```python
def build_execute_request(code: str, key: bytes) -> List[bytes]:
    header = {
        "msg_id": uuid.uuid4().hex,
        "session": uuid.uuid4().hex,
        "username": "demo",
        "msg_type": "execute_request",
        "version": "5.3",
        "date": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"),
    }
    content = {"code": code, "silent": False, "store_history": True, "allow_stdin": False}
    encoded = [canonical_json(header), canonical_json({}), canonical_json({}), canonical_json(content)]
    signature = sign_frames(key, encoded)
    return [b"", signature.encode("utf-8"), *encoded]
```

This mirrors the Jupyter wire format used by the bridge (`Envelope` and `Codec` in `src/HsJupyter/Bridge/Protocol/`).

## Connection File Reference

The kernel reads a Jupyter connection JSON and binds ZeroMQ sockets accordingly. Minimal fields used by `app/KernelMain.hs` and `HsJupyter.KernelProcess`:

- `ip`: host to bind (e.g., "127.0.0.1")
- `transport`: scheme (e.g., "tcp")
- `shell_port`, `iopub_port`, `control_port`, `stdin_port`, `hb_port`: port numbers
- `signature_scheme`: "hmac-sha256" or empty for none
- `key`: HMAC key (string)

See a working sample in `scripts/demo/sample-connection.json`.

## Troubleshooting

- Ports already in use
  - Edit `scripts/demo/sample-connection.json` to change `shell_port`, `iopub_port`, etc., then pass it via `--connection`.
- Missing GHC/cabal
  - Install via ghcup: `ghcup install ghc 9.12.2 cabal` and ensure they‚Äôre on PATH.
- pyzmq not installed
  - `pip install --user pyzmq` or use a virtualenv.
- ZeroMQ library issues
  - Ensure libzmq is available on your system. On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev`.

## Contributing

While the kernel is still under active design, we welcome feedback and discussion on the architecture. Please open an issue to share ideas or ask questions about the roadmap.
# Constitution v1.2.0 Compliance Implementation Plan

**Target**: Address moderate constitutional compliance gaps  
**Focus**: Error handling abstraction and Rule of Three compliance  
**Estimated Effort**: 6-9 hours

## Issue 1: Error Handling Abstraction (DRY Principle)

**Current State**: Error handling patterns repeated across modules  
**Constitutional Violation**: Principle VI (Simplicity & Maintainability) - DRY violation

### Implementation Tasks

#### T001: Create Shared Error Handling Module
Create `src/HsJupyter/Runtime/ErrorHandling.hs` with common error patterns

#### T002: Extract Common Error Combinators
Extract patterns from GHCRuntime.hs, GHCDiagnostics.hs, Manager.hs

#### T003: Update Modules to Use Shared Patterns
Refactor existing modules to use shared error handling

## Issue 2: Rule of Three Compliance (Pragmatic Balance)

**Current State**: Some abstractions created before pattern establishment  
**Constitutional Violation**: Principle VIII (Pragmatic Balance) - Rule of Three

### Implementation Tasks

#### T004: Review Abstractions for Rule of Three
Identify abstractions created before establishing clear patterns

#### T005: Simplify Over-Engineered Abstractions
Simplify where patterns don't justify abstraction

#### T006: Document Remaining Complexity
Justify remaining complex abstractions with explicit reasoning

## Expected Outcomes

1. **DRY Compliance**: Eliminate error handling code duplication
2. **Rule of Three Compliance**: Ensure abstractions are justified by usage patterns
3. **Maintainability**: Improved code maintainability through shared patterns
4. **Constitutional Score**: Increase from 92/100 to 96/100---

description: "Task list template for feature implementation"
---

# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Per the constitution, every user story must include the tests that will fail before implementation (unit, integration, docs as appropriate). Document these explicitly.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
  
  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/
  
  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment
  
  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================
-->

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 ‚ö†Ô∏è

> **MANDATORY: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations
- [ ] T018 [US1] Instrument telemetry/diagnostics and document resource guard updates

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2 ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T021 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T023 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T024 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)
- [ ] T025 [US2] Extend telemetry/diagnostics and resource guard configuration

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T027 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T028 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T029 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T030 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T031 [US3] Update telemetry, diagnostics, and documentation covering the new behaviour

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Constitution Guidance

Follow HsJupyter Constitution v1.2.0:

### Core Principles

- **Simplicity & Maintainability (VI)**: Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It). Eliminate code duplication through abstractions. Choose simplest solution that solves problem. Build only what specification requires.
- **Modular Architecture & Strong Design (V)**: Apply SOLID principles, use composition over inheritance, enforce separation of concerns. Hide implementation details behind clean interfaces.
- **Resilience & Defensive Programming (VII)**: Handle failures gracefully, apply Law of Demeter to reduce coupling, validate inputs, use structured error types (`RuntimeDiagnostic`).
- **Pragmatic Balance (VIII)**: Apply Rule of Three (don't refactor until pattern emerges), maximize cohesion within modules while minimizing coupling between them.

# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

> Align every user story with the constitution: document-first narrative, explicit pre-code tests, and observability hooks. Each story MUST describe how logging/metrics/diagnostics validate the behaviour.

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

# HsJupyter Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Documentation-First Development

Every feature begins with comprehensive documentation in `specs/` before any implementation work. Architecture decisions live in `docs/architecture.md`, roadmap updates in `docs/roadmap.md`, and contributor processes in `docs/developer/`. Specification artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md) MUST be complete and validated before proceeding to task generation. Code reviews reject work that lacks matching documentation or leaves design decisions undocumented.

### II. Test-First Implementation  

Tests MUST be written before implementation and MUST fail before code is written to make them pass. Mirror the module tree under `test/` with files following the pattern `ModuleNameSpec.hs`. Run `cabal v2-test` before opening any PR. Unit tests for all new modules, integration tests for user-facing features, and golden tests for protocol compatibility are mandatory. Test scenarios from user story acceptance criteria become automated tests.

### III. Specification-Driven Development

Follow the speckit workflow rigidly: `/speckit.specify` ‚Üí `/speckit.plan` ‚Üí `/speckit.tasks` ‚Üí `/speckit.implement`. Feature branches follow `NNN-feature-name` naming. Each phase (spec, plan, tasks) MUST be complete before proceeding to the next. User stories MUST be prioritized (P1, P2, P3) and independently testable. All acceptance scenarios become test cases.

### IV. Observability Foundation

Structured logging, metrics collection, and diagnostic reporting are mandatory from the earliest phases. Use `katip` for structured JSON logs with correlation IDs. Expose telemetry through the `Runtime/Telemetry.hs` module. Every runtime operation MUST support cancellation via TMVar tokens and resource monitoring via `ResourceGuard`. Error handling MUST use the structured `RuntimeDiagnostic` system with severity classification.

### V. Modular Architecture & Strong Design Foundation

Maintain the `HsJupyter.*` namespace with clear module separation: `Bridge/` for protocol integration, `Runtime/` for execution core, `Router/` for message dispatch, `Kernel/` for types. Apply SOLID principles to create modular, flexible, and testable systems. Each module MUST minimize dependencies and maximize clarity. Use composition over inheritance - combine small, reusable components rather than rigid hierarchies. Enforce separation of concerns to keep each module focused on a single responsibility. Use STM for thread-safe state management. Prefer total functions over partial functions. Every module MUST have comprehensive Haddock documentation with implementation details properly hidden behind clean interfaces. Follow four-space indentation and descriptive naming conventions.

### VI. Simplicity & Maintainability

Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles rigorously. Eliminate code duplication through shared utilities and type-safe abstractions. Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements - complex patterns MUST be justified with concrete benefits. Implement only features explicitly required by current user stories; speculative features are forbidden. Maintain strict separation of concerns across all modules and layers. Refactor ruthlessly to maintain clarity. When complexity is unavoidable, isolate it behind clean interfaces with comprehensive documentation.

### VII. Resilience & Defensive Programming

Anticipate and handle potential failures gracefully through comprehensive error handling and resource management. Apply the Law of Demeter to reduce tight coupling between components, keeping code modular and maintainable. Every public API MUST validate inputs and handle edge cases explicitly. Use structured error types (`RuntimeDiagnostic`) rather than throwing exceptions. Implement proper resource cleanup through `ResourceGuard` and bracketing patterns. All network operations, file I/O, and external process interactions MUST include timeout handling and graceful degradation. Design systems to fail safely and provide meaningful diagnostic information.

### VIII. Pragmatic Balance & Evolution

Apply the Rule of Three - don't refactor until repetition proves a pattern is worth abstracting. Maximize cohesion within modules while minimizing coupling between them to keep components self-contained yet cleanly interacting. Balance optimization with simplicity - premature optimization is forbidden, but performance requirements MUST be specified and validated. Make architectural decisions based on concrete evidence rather than speculation. When refactoring, preserve existing interfaces unless breaking changes provide substantial benefits. Document trade-offs explicitly in design decisions.

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

### Branching Strategy

Create numbered feature branches (`003-ghc-evaluation`) with meaningful commits in imperative mood. Each commit MUST summarize behavior changes and reference roadmap items. PRs MUST include coverage reports, demo steps, and flag open questions as checklists.

### Quality Standards  

- Haskell code MUST follow project style guidelines (four-space indentation, `HsJupyter.*` namespace)
- All public APIs MUST have Haddock comments
- Performance requirements MUST be specified and validated (e.g., <200ms evaluation, <2s startup)
- Resource constraints MUST be enforced (CPU, memory, output limits)
- Error scenarios MUST be comprehensively tested

### Implementation Phases

- **Phase 1**: Setup and infrastructure
- **Phase 2**: Foundational prerequisites (blocking - no user stories until complete)  
- **Phase 3+**: User stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3)
- **Final Phase**: Polish, documentation, and cross-cutting concerns

## Technology Standards

### Core Stack

- **Language**: Haskell with GHC 9.12.2+ via ghcup
- **Concurrency**: STM for state management, TMVar for cancellation
- **Protocol**: ZeroMQ (`zeromq4-haskell`) for Jupyter integration
- **JSON**: `aeson` for serialization
- **Testing**: `hspec` for unit and integration tests
- **Logging**: `katip` for structured logging

### Performance Targets

- Simple operations: <200ms response time
- Session initialization: <2 seconds  
- Memory baseline: <100MB for typical workflows
- Resource limits: CPU, memory, and output monitoring mandatory

### Integration Requirements

All new features MUST maintain compatibility with existing Phase 1 (Protocol Bridge) and Phase 2 (Runtime Core) infrastructure. Preserve STM-based job queues, TMVar cancellation, ResourceGuard limits, and diagnostic reporting.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require documentation of rationale, approval from maintainers, and a migration plan for affected artifacts. All PRs and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity that violates principles MUST be explicitly justified with simpler alternatives documented as rejected.

For runtime development guidance, reference `AGENTS.md` for agent workflow specifics and `.specify/` scripts for tooling usage.
