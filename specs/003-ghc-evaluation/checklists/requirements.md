# Specification Quality Checklist: GHC Evaluation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on user value (Haskell REPL functionality) without implementation details  
✅ **PASS** - Written for business stakeholders with clear problem/solution narrative  
✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections (User Stories, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment  

✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present in specification  
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are testable with concrete acceptance scenarios  
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria include measurable metrics (evaluation time, success rates)  
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes)  
✅ **PASS** - Comprehensive acceptance scenarios for all user stories  
✅ **PASS** - Edge cases covered (syntax errors, resource limits, performance)  
✅ **PASS** - Clear scope boundaries and exclusions defined  
✅ **PASS** - Dependencies on Phase 2 Runtime Core clearly identified

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - All functional requirements have corresponding acceptance criteria  
✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover complete workflow from basic evaluation to advanced features  
✅ **PASS** - Measurable outcomes align with business value (REPL functionality)  
✅ **PASS** - No implementation leakage (hint library mentioned only in technical context)

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ **SPECIFICATION READY**

All validation criteria passed. The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for implementation planning.

## Notes

- Specification demonstrates mature understanding of user needs for Haskell REPL functionality
- Proper prioritization with P1 core features and P2/P3 enhancements
- Comprehensive coverage of evaluation, persistence, imports, and error handling
- Strong focus on user experience and measurable outcomes
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` command to proceed to implementation planning
