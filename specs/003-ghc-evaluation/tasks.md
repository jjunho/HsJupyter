# Tasks: GHC Evaluation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-ghc-evaluation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification, focusing on implementation tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Single project structure extending existing HsJupyter.Runtime.* namespace:

- **Source**: `src/HsJupyter/Runtime/`
- **Tests**: `test/unit/`, `test/integration/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 session management but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of US1/US2, uses same session infrastructure
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent diagnostic system, works with all evaluation types
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Cross-cutting performance layer, integrates with all stories

### Within Each User Story

- Implementation tasks can run in parallel where marked [P] (different files, no dependencies)
- Core functionality before integration tasks
- Unit tests can run in parallel with implementation
- Integration tests after core implementation complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel
- Within each story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch parallel implementation tasks for User Story 1:
Task: "Implement evaluateExpression function in src/HsJupyter/Runtime/GHCRuntime.hs"
Task: "Add expression timeout wrapper (1s timeout) in src/HsJupyter/Runtime/GHCRuntime.hs"
Task: "Add type error detection and mapping in src/HsJupyter/Runtime/GHCDiagnostics.hs"
Task: "Create unit test for basic expression evaluation in test/unit/GHCRuntimeSpec.hs"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic Expression Evaluation)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Variable Persistence)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test core REPL functionality independently
6. Deploy/demo functional Haskell kernel

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Basic evaluation works
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Persistent REPL complete (MVP!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Module system functional
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Production-ready error handling
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Enterprise-ready performance
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous functionality

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Basic Evaluation)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Persistence)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Imports)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently via shared session infrastructure

## Implementation Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Preserve all existing Phase 2 functionality - zero breaking changes
- Follow existing STM patterns and HsJupyter.* namespace conventions
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently

## Constitution Guidance

Follow HsJupyter Constitution v1.1.0 Principle VI: Simplicity & Maintainability

- Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Eliminate code duplication through abstractions
- Follow KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Choose simplest solution that solves problem  
- Practice YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Build only what specification requires
